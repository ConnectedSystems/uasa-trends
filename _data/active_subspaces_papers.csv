We employ a novel methodology based on active subspaces to characterize the effects of the input uncertainty on the scramjet performance. The active subspace identifies one-dimensional structure in the map from simulation inputs to quantity of interest that allows us to reparameterize the operating conditions; instead of seven physical parameters, we can use a single derived active variable. This dimension reduction enables otherwise infeasible uncertainty quantification, considering the simulation cost of roughly  CPU-hours per run. For two values of the fuel injection rate, we use a total of  simulations to (i) identify the parameters that contribute the most to the variation in the output quantity of interest, (ii) estimate upper and lower bounds on the quantity of interest, (iii) classify sets of operating conditions as safe or unsafe corresponding to a threshold on the output quantity of interest, and (iv) estimate a cumulative distribution function for the quantity of interest.", (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The underlying models contain several physical input parameters that affect model predictions. Effective design and analysis must understand the sensitivity of model predictions to changes in model parameters, but global sensitivity analyses become increasingly challenging as the number of input parameters increases. Active subspaces are part of an emerging set of tools for discovering and exploiting low-dimensional structures in the map from high-dimensional inputs to model outputs. We extend linear and quadratic model-based heuristics for active subspace discovery to time-dependent processes and apply the resulting technique to a lithium ion battery model. The results reveal low-dimensional structure and sensitivity metrics that a designer may exploit to study the relationship between parameters and predictions.",,"Constantine, PG|Doostan, A",STATISTICAL ANALYSIS AND DATA MINING,computer experiments sufficient dimension reduction uncertainty quantification,10.1002/sam.11347

Uncertainty of input parameter values is inherent in any model and the sensitivity of output to these uncertain parameters becomes an important consideration. To better understand these connections in the context of hydrologic models, we use the ParFlow-Common Land Model (PF-CLM) to estimate energy fluxes given variations in  vegetation and land surface parameters over a -hour period of time. Latent, sensible and ground heat fluxes from bare soil and grass vegetation were estimated using single column and tilted-v domains. Energy flux outputs, along with the corresponding input parameters, from each of the four scenario simulations were evaluated using active subspaces. The active subspace method considers parameter sensitivity by quantifying a weight for each parameter. The method also evaluates the potential for dimension reduction by identifying the input-output relationship through the active variable - a linear combination of input parameters. The aerodynamic roughness length was the most important parameter for bare soil energy fluxes. Multiple parameters were important for energy fluxes from vegetated surfaces and depended on the type of energy flux. Relationships between land surface inputs and output fluxes varied between latent, sensible and ground heat, but were consistent between domain setup (i.e., with or without lateral flow) and vegetation type. A quadratic polynomial was used to describe the input-output relationship for these energy fluxes. The reduced-dimension model of land surface dynamics can be compared to observations or used to solve the inverse problem. Considering this work as a proof-of concept, the active subspace method can be applied and extended to a range of domain setups, land cover types and time periods to obtain a reduced-form representation of any output of interest, provided that an active subspace exists.

To cope with the cost of simulations, one replaces the real response surface with a cheap surrogate based, e.g., on polynomial chaos expansions, neural networks, support vector machines, or Gaussian processes (GP). However, the number of simulations required to learn a generic multivariate response grows exponentially as the input dimension increases. This curse of dimensionality can only be addressed, if the response exhibits some special structure that can be discovered and exploited. A wide range of physical responses exhibit a special structure known as an active subspace (AS). An AS is a linear manifold of the stochastic space characterized by maximal response variation. The idea is that one should first identify this low dimensional manifold, project the high-dimensional input onto it, and then link the projection to the output. If the dimensionality of the AS is low enough, then learning the link function is a much easier problem than the original problem of learning a high-dimensional function. The classic approach to discovering the AS requires gradient information, a fact that severely limits its applicability. Furthermore, and partly because of its reliance to gradients, it is not able to handle noisy observations. The latter is an essential trait if one wants to be able to propagate uncertainty through stochastic simulators, e.g., through molecular dynamics codes. In this work, we develop a probabilistic version of AS which is gradient-free and robust to observational noise. Our approach relies on a novel Gaussian process regression with built-in dimensionality reduction. In particular, the AS is represented as an orthogonal projection matrix that serves as yet another covariance function hyper-parameter to be estimated from the data. To train the model, we design a two-step maximum likelihood optimization procedure that ensures the orthogonality of the projection matrix by exploiting recent results on the Stiefel manifold, i.e., the manifold of matrices with orthogonal columns. The additional benefit of our probabilistic formulation, is that it allows us to select the dimensionality of the AS via the Bayesian information criterion. We validate our approach by showing that it can discover the right AS in synthetic examples without gradient information using both noiseless and noisy observations. We demonstrate that our method is able to discover the same AS as the classical approach in a challenging one-hundred-dimensional problem involving an elliptic stochastic partial differential equation with random conductivity. Finally, we use our approach to study the effect of geometric and material uncertainties in the propagation of solitary waves in a one dimensional granular system.", (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

This technique uses samples of the gradient of the quantity of interest (QoI) to partition the uncertainty domain into ""active"" and ""passive"" subspaces. The passive subspace is characterized by near-constant behavior of the quantity of interest, while the active subspace contains the most important dynamics of the stochastic system. We also present a procedure to project the model onto the low-dimensional active subspace that enables the resulting approximation to be solved using conventional techniques. Unlike the classical Karhunen-Loeve expansion, the advantage of this approach is that it is applicable to fully nonlinear problems and does not require any assumptions on the correlation between the random inputs. This work also provides a rigorous convergence analysis of the quantity of interest and demonstrates: at least linear convergence with respect to the number of samples. It also shows that the convergence rate is independent of the number of input random variables. Thus, applied to a reducible problem, our approach can approximate the statistics of the QoI to within desired error tolerance at a cost that is orders of magnitude lower than standard Monte Carlo. Finally, several numerical examples demonstrate the feasibility of our approach and are used to illustrate the theoretical results. In particular, we validate our convergence estimates through the application of this approach to a reactor criticality problem with a large number of random cross-section parameters.",,"Stoyanov, M|Webster, CG",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR UNCERTAINTY QUANTIFICATION,representation of uncertainty stochastic model reduction method stochastic sensitivity analysis high-dimensional approximation stochastic partial differential equations karhunen-loeve expansion monte carlo,10.1615/Int.J.UncertaintyQuantification.2014010945
7,WOS:000363467100002,2015,Discovering an active subspace in a single-diode solar cell model,SENSITIVITY-ANALYSIS,"Predictions from science and engineering models depend on the values of the model's input parameters. As the number of parameters increases, algorithmic parameter studies such as optimization and uncertainty quantification require many more model evaluations. One way to combat this curse of dimensionality is to seek an alternative parameterization with fewer variables that produces comparable predictions. The active subspace is a low-dimensional linear subspace defined by important directions in the model's input space; input perturbations along these directions change the model's prediction more, on average, than perturbations orthogonal to the important directions. We describe a method for checking if a model admits an exploitable active subspace and apply this method to a single-diode solar cell model with five input parameters. We find that the maximum power of the solar cell has a dominant one-dimensional active subspace, which enables us to perform thorough parameter studies in one dimension instead of five.",,"Constantine, PG|Zaharatos, B|Campanelli, M",STATISTICAL ANALYSIS AND DATA MINING,single-diode solar cell model active subspaces dimension reduction parameterized simulations,10.1002/sam.11281
