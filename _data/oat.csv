The computations focus on short-time, high-resolution simulations of the Gulf of Mexico, using the hybrid coordinate ocean model, with wind stresses corresponding to hurricane Ivan. A sparse quadrature approach is used to determine the PC coefficients which provides a detailed representation of the stochastic model response. The quality of the PC representation is first examined through a systematic refinement of the number of resolution levels. The PC representation of the stochastic model response is then utilized to compute distributions of quantities of interest (QoIs) and to analyze the local and global sensitivity of these QoIs to uncertain parameters. Conclusions are finally drawn regarding limitations of local perturbations and variance-based assessment and concerning potential application of the present methodology to inverse problems and to uncertainty management.",,"Alexanderian, A|Winokur, J|Sraj, I|Srinivasan, A|Iskandarani, M|Thacker, WC|Knio, OM",COMPUTATIONAL GEOSCIENCES,ocean circulation model parametric uncertainty sensitivity analysis polynomial chaos sparse quadrature,10.1007/s10596-012-9286-2

The physical, chemical and biological processes that take place inside a lake are very complex. A simple analysis of the field data is not enough. Even if those dates offers an appreciation of the global functioning of the ecosystem under the influence of certain factors, it does not allow to predict the system evolution, the optimization of the water arrangement, in order to respect and to assure the water quality criteria or to propose solutions for diminishing the lakes eutrophication. In the recent years. Lake Izvorul Muntelui, which is the largest artificial lake on the interior waters of Romania, experienced eutrophication problems. This paper analyzes the apparition condition, its effects onto water quality in the lake and the solutions for the rehabilitation of the ecosystem. Since systematic measured data are not available for this ecosystem, the mathematical modelling it is used. The simulation is done by considering the ecosystem dynamic and the stipulation of the spatial and temporal variation domains for the natural processes to appear and act onto perturbation factors to modify the ecological succession. Thus, different scenarios will be created allowing us to offer solutions for the eutrophication phenomenon and, in the same time, to identify solutions for the rehabilitation of the Izvorul Muntelui Lake.", (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Few studies address the possibility of using plants to remediate these soils. The objectives of this research were to determine whether barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), a salt-tolerant crop, would grow in lagoon soil and to determine the effect of plant residue amendments on barley growth and soil physical properties. The lagoon soil was collected from a closed swine lagoon. Oat-straw and corn-cob residues were added at rates of  (control), , , , , and  g/kg lagoon soil. Barley grew in all soils, including the soil with no residues. Average grain yield of plants in pots with oat straw was more than twice that of plants in pots with corn cobs (. g/pot and . g/pot, respectively). Bulk density and oxygen diffusion rate decreased with increasing amounts of residue in the soil. Infiltration was lower in pots with oat straw than in pots with corn cobs. Irrigation water moved rapidly through macropores visible in the soil with corn cobs. The soil amended with corn cobs retained less water, causing poor growth of the barley. The results showed that corn-cob residue created preferential flow paths in the lagoon soil.",,"Liphadzi, MS|Kirkham, MB|Mankin, KR",SOIL & SEDIMENT CONTAMINATION,,10.1080/20025891107096

The method combines the benefits of the two leading approaches, hierarchical Latin hypercube sampling (HLHS) and refined stratified sampling, to produce a method that significantly reduces the variance of statistical estimators for very high-dimensional problems. The method works by hierarchically creating sample designs that are both Latin and stratified. The intermediate sample designs are then produced using the refined stratified sampling method. This causes statistical estimates to converge at rates that are equal to or better than HLHS while affording maximal flexibility in sample size extension (one-at-a-time or n-at-a-time sampling are possible) that does not exist in HLHS-which grows the sample size exponentially. The properties of the method are highlighted for several very high-dimensional problems, demonstrating the method has the distinct benefit of rapid convergence for transformations of all kinds.",,"Shields, MD",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR UNCERTAINTY QUANTIFICATION,uncertainty quantification monte carlo simulation stratified sampling latin hypercube sampling sample size extension,10.1615/Int.J.UncertaintyQuantification.2016011333

A new interval sensitivity-analysis method for vibro-acoustic systems is proposed in this paper. This method relies on only interval perturbation analysis instead of partial derivatives and difference operations. For strongly nonlinear systems, in particular, this methodology requires parameter variation over narrower ranges in comparison with other methods. To implement sensitivity analysis based on this method, the interval ranges of the responses of the vibro-acoustic system with interval parameters should first be obtained. Therefore, an interval perturbation-analysis method is presented for obtaining the interval bounds of the sound-pressure responses of a coupled vibro-acoustic system with interval parameters. The interval perturbation method is then compared with the Monte Carlo method, which can be taken as the benchmark for comparative accuracy. Two numerical examples involving sensitivity analysis of vibro-acoustic systems illustrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed interval-based method.", (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The simulations are based on the numerical model HydroGeoSphere, which solves D variably-saturated flow and solute transport in discretely-fractured porous media. Using detailed knowledge of the matrix, fracture, and biopore properties, the numerical model is calibrated and validated against experimental high-resolution tracer images/data collected under dry and wet soil conditions and for three different rain events. The model could reproduce reasonably well the observed preferential migration of AY and SB through the fractured till, although it did not capture the exact depth of migration and the negligible impact of the dead-end biopores in a near-saturated matrix.

Despite that many LCA methods remain sensitive to uncertain input data, which can reduce the utility of their results, uncertainty arising from constituent LCA models remains poorly understood. Here, we begin to address this problem by evaluating the extent to which parameter-value uncertainty affects the SimpleBox . fate and transport model, which serves as a backbone for many LCA ecotoxicological impact categories. Two Monte Carlo type sampling methods were used to evaluate dispersion in steady-state concentration values for three chemicals involved in grenade production: toluene, ,-dinitrotoluene (,-DNT), and ,,-trinitrotoluene (TNT). Parameters were first sampled stochastically one-at-a-time, then by randomly exploring a local patch of the parameter space. We confirmed that global temperatures contribute primarily to the overall variance of model results, which at most spanned approximately  decades in magnitude. These results are consistent with previous results obtained for the whole of the LCA method. LCA methods carry out calculations iteratively; a reduction in the error of a single component, such as the fate and transport model, may therefore improve its performance and utility as a decision-making aid.", Published by Elsevier B.V.,"Mayo, M|Collier, ZA|Hoang, V|Chappell, M",SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,uncertainty sensitivity analysis life cycle assessment fate and transport model simplebox trinitrotoluene,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2014.06.061

Although impacts of combined ocean acidification (OA) and temperature stress (T) on reef-building scleractinian corals have been studied at the genus, species and population levels, there are little data available on how individual corals respond to combined OA and anomalous temperatures. In this study, we exposed individual colonies of Acropora digitifera, Montipora digitata and Porites cylindrica to four pCO()-temperature treatments including  mu atm- degrees C,  mu atm- degrees C,  mu atm- degrees C and  mu atm- degrees C for  days. Physiological parameters including calcification, protein content, maximum photosynthetic efficiency, Symbiodinium density, and chlorophyll content along with Symbiodinium type of each colony were examined. Along with intercolonial responses, responses of individual colonies versus pooled data to the treatments were investigated. The main results were: ) responses to either OA or T or their combination were different between individual colonies when considering physiological functions; ) tolerance to either OA or T was not synonymous with tolerance to the other parameter; ) tolerance to both OA and T did not necessarily lead to tolerance of OA and T combined (OAT) at the same time; ) OAT had negative, positive or no impacts on physiological functions of coral colonies; and ) pooled data were not representative of responses of all individual colonies. Indeed, the pooled data obscured actual responses of individual colonies or presented a response that was not observed in any individual. From the results of this study we recommend improving experimental designs of studies investigating physiological responses of corals to climate change by complementing them with colony-specific examinations.

The present work is focused on continuing to advance understanding on how sensitive the solution of the forward EEG problem is in regard to the geometry of the head. This has been achieved by developing a novel analytic algorithm by performing a perturbation analysis in the linear regime using a homogenous spherical model. Notably, the suggested procedure provides a criterion which recognizes whether surface deformations will have an impact on EEG recordings. The presented deformations represent two major cases: () acquired alterations of the surface inflicted by external forces and () deformations of the upper part of the human head where EEG signals are recorded. Our results illustrate that neglecting geometric variations present on the heads surface leads to errors in the recorded EEG measurements less than %. However, for severe instances of deformations combined with cortical brain activity in the vicinity of the distortion site, the errors rise to almost %. Therefore, the accurate description of the head shape plays an important role in understanding the forward EEG problem only in these cases.",,"Doschoris, M|Dassios, G|Fragoyiannis, G",MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING,,10.1155/2015/612528

Soil losses in the three systems were moderate (<.

During the resting period of the AV system (), the annual runoff increased from  to about  per cent, compared to IT and TO without grazing. The difference in runoff was attributed to an  per cent increase in bulk density of soil surface (- cm) caused by cattle trampling while grazing. Nutrient losses in the three treatments were mainly of N, Ca+, Mg+, Na+, and K+. These results suggest that AV has a higher topsoil degradation effect during the resting year than during the cultivation period.

The mineralogical composition of the argillite is modified at the interface with the concrete. Diffusion of cementitious elements leads to rapid and strong porosity occlusion in the argillite. Numerical results show that both reaction rates and spatial refinement affect mineralogical transformation pathways. The variations in porosity and the extension of the zone affected by the alkaline perturbation are compared at different times. The major effects of mineral precipitation under kinetic constraints, rather than local equilibrium, are a delay in the porosity clogging and an increase in the extension of the alkaline perturbation in the clay formation.

Previously unrecognized agricultural emissions may explain why O- concentrations in the SJV have not responded to traditional emissions control programs. In the present study, the ozone formation potentials (OFP) of livestock feed emissions were measured on representative field samples using a transportable smog chamber. Seven feeds were considered: cereal silage (wheat grain and oat grain), alfalfa silage, corn silage, high moisture ground corn (HMGC), almond shells, almond hulls, and total mixed ration (TMR = % corn silage, % corn grain, % almond hulls, % hay, % bran + seeds, and % protein + vitamins + minerals). The measured short-term OFP for each gram of reactive organic gas (ROG) emissions from all livestock feed was .-. g-O- per g-ROG. For reference, OFP of exhaust from light duty gasoline powered cars under the same conditions is . +/- . g-O- per g-ROG. Model calculations were able to reproduce the ozone formation from animal feeds indicating that the measured ROG compounds account for the observed ozone formation (i.e., ozone closure was achieved). Ethanol and other alcohol species accounted for more than % of the ozone formation for most types of feed. Aldehydes were also significant contributors for cereal silage, high moisture ground corn, and total mixed ration. Ozone production calculations based on feed consumption rates, RUG emissions rates, and OFP predict that animal feed emissions dominate the RUG contributions to ozone formation in the SJV with total production of  +/-  t O- day(-). The next most significant RUG source of ozone production in the SJV is estimated to be light duty vehicles with total production of . +/- . t O- day(-). The majority of the animal feed ozone formation is attributed to corn silage. Future work should be conducted to reduce the uncertainty of RUG emissions from animal feeds in the SJV and to include this significant source of ozone formation in regional airshed models.",,"Howard, CJ|Kumar, A|Malkina, I|Mitloehner, F|Green, PG|Flocchini, RG|Kleeman, MJ",ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY,,10.1021/es902864u

In the two adjacent soils, microbial biomass in the litter estimated by fumigation-extraction (FE) decreased continuously after day  and the substrate-induced respiration (SIR) peaked at day . As a result, the SIR-to-FE-ratio referring to the metabolic responsive biomass increased until day  and decreased afterwards. This ratio indicated that metabolic responsive biomass became rapidly active and later dormant or inactive, which was most apparent in the forest soil. The basal respiration increased continuously until day  and then it decreased. In the first  weeks, bacteria estimated with the inhibition technique dominated the microbial biomass on the decomposing litter in the forest soil and fungi dominated the microbial biomass in the cropland soil.

Improved understanding of dynamics of soil extractable organic carbon (EOC) and nitrogen (EON) under cover crops is useful for developing effective agronomic management and nitrogen (N) fertilization strategies. Dynamics of soil extractable inorganic and organic carbon (C) and N pools were investigated under six cover crop treatments, which included two legume crops (capello woolly pod vetch and field pea), three non-legume crops (wheat, Saia oat and Indian mustard), and a nil-crop control (CK) in southeastern Australia. Cover crops at anthesis were crimp-rolled onto the soil surface in October . Soil and crop residue samples were taken over the periods October-December () and March-May (), respectively, to examine remaining crop residue biomass, soil NH (+)-N and NO (-)-N as well as EOC and EON concentrations using extraction methods of  M KCl and hot water. Additionally, soil net N mineralization rates were measured for soil samples collected in May . The CK treatment had the highest soil inorganic N (NH (+)-N + NO (-)-N) at the sampling time in December  but decreased greatly with sampling time. The cover crop treatments had greater soil EOC and EON concentrations than the CK treatment. However, no significant differences in soil NH (+)-N, NO (-)-N, EOC, EON, and ratios of EOC to EON were found between the legume and non-legume cover crop treatments across the sampling times, which were supported by the similar results of soil net N mineralization rates among the treatments. Stepwise multiple regression analyses indicated that soil EOC in the hot water extracts was mainly affected by soil total C ( () = ., < .), while the crop residue biomass determined soil EON in the hot water extracts ( () = ., < .). The cover crop treatments had lower loss of soil inorganic N compared with the CK treatment across the sampling times. The legume and non-legume cover crop treatments did not significantly differ in soil EOC and EON pools across the sampling times. In addition, the decomposition of cover crop residues had more influence on soil EON than the decomposition of soil organic matter (SOM), which indicated less N fertilization under cover crop residues. On the other hand, the decomposition of SOM exerted more influence on soil EOC across the sampling times among the treatments, implying different C and N cycling under cover crops.",,"Zhou, XQ|Chen, CR|Wu, HW|Xu, ZH",JOURNAL OF SOILS AND SEDIMENTS,cover crop crop residue legume non-legume soil extractable organic c soil extractable organic n soil inorganic n,10.1007/s11368-012-0515-z

Local sensitivity analysis was employed to select model parameters that needed to be re-estimated from the previous studies. This model was validated by experimental data from both a bench- and a large-scale MDC system. It could fit current generation fairly well and simulate the change of salt concentration. It was able to predict the response of the MDC with time under various conditions, and also provide information for analyzing the effects of different operating conditions. Furthermore, optimal operating conditions for the MDC used in this study were estimated to have an acetate flow rate of . mL.min(-), influent salt concentration of  g.L- and salt solution flow rate of . mL.min(-), and to be operated with an external resistor less than  O.

Sewage sludge is the predominant sewage fertiliser product available today, but the use of sewage sludge in agriculture has been questioned as regards hazardous substances. In this respect, blackwater from separating systems seems to better fulfil agricultural requirements regarding fertiliser products. The objective of this paper was to analyse the environmental impact and resource use in a life cycle perspective for three systems, each including both wastewater handling and agricultural production. In the reference system, food waste disposers were installed in houses. Milled food waste and wastewater were treated in a wastewater treatment plant and the sewage sludge was used for producing a soil conditioner. In the sludge utilisation system, food waste from households was composted, wastewater was treated conventionally and sewage sludge was used in oat production. In the blackwater system, toilet water from low-flush toilets and milled organic waste were digested together and spread in growing oats. Data on the wastewater system were derived from simulations by the substance-flow model URWARE/ORWARE. The blackwater system required slightly more primary energy than the other two systems. In particular, construction of storage facilities contributed considerably to energy use. The emissions of greenhouse gases and SO were of the same magnitude for all three systems, while the eutrophying emissions were reduced significantly in the blackwater system. As regards NH and NOx, the emissions were highest for the blackwater system. High substitution of mineral fertiliser, optimal spreading technique and well-designed collection and storage facilities were important factors for the environmental outcome in the blackwater system.", (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

After their multiplication and ample irrigation, seedlings were cultivated for  weeks under optimal or limiting water supply (respectively,  and % of field capacity, FC). A subset of stressed plants was thereafter subjected to the optimal regime of irrigation. Weekly harvests were carried out during  days of treatment. Measured parameters were growth, tissue water and proline contents, as well as ornithine-delta-aminotransferase (delta-OAT. EC ...) and proline dehydrogenase (PDH, EC ...) activities. Water deficit reduced the growth (whole plant biomass and leaf number). increased root/shoot ratio and led to a significant decrease in leaf relative water content (RWC). In water-stressed plants, the concentration of K+, Na+, Cl- and proline, as well as delta-OAT activity increased significantly. Inversely, PDH activity was impaired. Rewatering stressed plants restored these parameters at values close to those of plants permanently irrigated with % FC. It can be assumed that ornithine pathway contributed via an increase in delta-OAT activity to proline synthesis in water-stressed plants of S. portulacastrum at the adult stage.

Thus, this study concerns the LCA of an environmentally friendly material used for building construction, hemp concrete. The functional unit is first defined per square metre such that the wall may provide the function of bearing wall and its thermal performance is described by a thermal resistance of . m() K/W. The results then showed that the production phase of raw materials is mainly responsible for the environmental impact of the wall, mostly due to the binder production. It was also shown that, compared to traditional construction materials, hemp concrete has a low impact on environment. Moreover, hemp concrete contributes to reduce climate change as photosynthesis-mediated carbon sequestration and carbonation serve to reduce atmospheric carbon dioxide. A sensitivity analysis is performed on three criteria: wall thickness, renewal of coatings and compounds of the indoor coating. Our results show that environmental indicators evolve with wall thickness, except for the climate change indicator. It improves with thickness due to carbon sequestration and carbonation. Moreover the increase in the wall's thermal resistance with wall thickness is not taken into account in such an LCA performed at the material level. The renewal of coating slightly impacts the environmental indicator for small numbers of renewals but it leads to negative effects if they are too numerous. It appears that hemp-lime coating has a greater impact than sand-lime coating as it embeds more binder. (C) ", Elsevier Ltd.

Using matrix derivatives we calculate the Taylor approximation of the LS estimator in the SAR model up to the second order. In a next step, we compare the covariance structure of the two estimators by Kantorovich inequalities and derive efficiency comparisons by upper bounds. Finally, we explore the quality of our new approximations by a Monte Carlo simulation study. The simulation results show significant computation time reductions and a good approximation behaviour of the SAR LS estimator in the neighborhood of rho = , when using a non-spatial LS estimator.

The suitable model structure is highly dependent on various criteria, i.e. the modeling objective, the characteristics and the scale of the system under investigation and the available data. Flexible environments for model building are available, but need to be assisted by proper diagnostic tools for model structure selection. This paper introduces a qualitative method for model component sensitivity analysis. Traditionally, model sensitivity is evaluated for model parameters. In this paper, the concept is translated into an evaluation of model structure sensitivity. Similarly to the one-factor-at-a-time (OAT) methods for parameter sensitivity, this method varies the model structure components one at a time and evaluates the change in sensitivity towards the output variables. As such, the effect of model component variations can be evaluated towards different objective functions or output variables. The methodology is presented for a simple lumped hydrological model environment, introducing different possible model building variations. By comparing the effect of changes in model structure for different model objectives, model selection can be better evaluated. Based on the presented component sensitivity analysis of a case study, some suggestions with regard to model selection are formulated for the system under study: () a non-linear storage component is recommended, since it ensures more sensitive (identifiable) parameters for this component and less parameter interaction; () interflow is mainly important for the low flow criteria; () excess infiltration process is most influencing when focussing on the lower flows; () a more simple routing component is advisable; and () baseflow parameters have in general low sensitivity values, except for the low flow criteria.", (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We extend the well-studied problem of component importance measures in single-commodity networks to multi-commodity networks by integrating a flow based multi-commodity optimization model with a multi-criteria decision analysis tool. A three-stage approach is proposed to assess critical component importance with multi-commodity impacts on network vulnerability of one-at-a-time component disruptions. We analyze commodity-specific impacts on network performance of the Swedish railway system to rank critical links with respect to the  different commodity types transported in the network. We conclude that the two proposed metrics to measure vulnerability, unmet demand and link usage over %, give complementary information regarding the vulnerability of the network. It is further concluded that the approach supports exploration of how the lack of redundancy and capacity in the network can give rise to high levels of unmet demand or increased link usage for specific commodities that are transported in the network, although the overall robustness of the railway system towards single link failures is high.

In particular, the reconstruction of palaeoatmospheric Co- content (C-a) is needed to assist the separation of natural from anthropogenic C-a variability and to explore phase relations between C-a and air temperature T-a time series. Both T-a and C-a are needed to fingerprint anthropogenic signatures in vapor pressure deficit, a major driver used to explain acceleration or deceleration phases in the global hydrological cycle. Current approaches to C-a reconstruction rely on a robust inverse correlation between measured stomatal density in leaves (nu) of many plant taxa and C-a. There are two methods that exploit this correlation: The first uses calibration curves obtained from extant species assumed to represent the fossil taxa, thereby restricting the suitable taxa to those existing today. The second is a hybrid eco-hydrological/physiological approach that determines C-a with the aid of systems of equations based on quasi-instantaneous leaf-gas exchange theories and fossil stomatal data collected along with other measured leaf anatomical traits and parameters. In this contribution, a reduced order model (ROM) is proposed that derives C-a from a single equation incorporating the aforementioned stomatal data, basic climate (e.g. temperature), estimated biochemical parameters of assimilation and isotope data. The usage of the ROM is then illustrated by applying it to isotopic and anatomical measurements from three extant species. The ROM derivation is based on a balance between the biochemical demand and atmospheric supply of Co- that leads to an explicit expression linking stomatal conductance to internal Co- concentration (C-i) and C-a. The resulting expression of stomatal conductance from the carbon economy of the leaf is then equated to another expression derived from water vapor gas diffusion that includes anatomical traits. When combined with isotopic measurements for long-term C-i/C-a, C-a can be analytically determined and is interpreted as the time-averaged C-a that existed over the life-span of the leaf. Key advantages of the proposed ROM are: ) the usage of isotopic data provides constraints on the reconstructed atmospheric Co- concentration from., ) the analytical form of this approach permits direct links between parameter uncertainties and reconstructed C-a, and ) the time-scale mismatch between the application of instantaneous leaf-gas exchange expressions constrained with longer-term isotopic data is reconciled through averaging rules and sensitivity analysis. The latter point was rarely considered in prior reconstruction studies that combined models of leaf-gas exchange and isotopic data to reconstruct C-a from nu. The proposed ROM is not without its limitations given the need to a priori assume a parameter related to the control on photosynthetic rate. The work here further explores immanent constraints for the aforementioned photosynthetic parameter. (C) ", Elsevier Ltd.

The use of derivative information amounts to a correction to the standard Monte Carlo estimation procedure that reduces the variance under certain conditions. We express the finite element models in variational form using the high-level Unified Form Language (UFL). We derive the tangent linear model automatically from this high-level description and use it to efficiently calculate the required derivative information. To study the effectiveness of the derivative-driven method we consider two stochastic PDEs; a one-dimensional Burgers equation with stochastic viscosity and a three-dimensional geometrically non-linear Mooney-Rivlin hyperelastic equation with stochastic density and volumetric material parameter. Our results show that for these problems the first-order derivative-driven Monte Carlo method is around one order of magnitude faster than the standard Monte Carlo method and at the cost of only one extra tangent linear solution per estimation problem. We find similar trends when comparing with a modern non-intrusive multi-level polynomial chaos expansion method.

This source-tagged model system could simultaneously track spatial and temporal sources of S-N-A, which were apportioned to their respective primary precursors in a simulation run. The results indicate that in the study period, local emissions in Shanghai accounted for over % of S-N-A contributions and that Jiangsu and Shandong were the two major non-local sources. In particular, non-local emissions had higher contributions during recorded pollution periods. This suggests that the transportation of pollutants plays a key role in air pollution in Shanghai. The temporal contributions show that the emissions from the ""current day"" (emission contribution from the current day during which the model was simulating) contributed %-% of the sulfate and ammonium concentrations but only %-% of the nitrate concentration, while the previous days' contributions increased during the recorded pollution periods. Emissions that were released within three days contributed over % averagely for S-N-A in January .

Sensitivity analysis in least squares linear regression has seen a great surge of research activities over the last three decades. By contrast, sensitivity analysis in non-linear regression has received very little attention. This paper deals with the problem of local sensitivity analysis in non-linear regression. Closed-form general formulas are provided for the sensitivities of three standard methods for the estimation of the parameters of a non-linear regression model based on a set of data. These methods are the least squares, the minimax, and the least absolute value methods. The effectiveness of the proposed measures is illustrated by application to several non-linear models including the ultrasonic data and the onion yield data.

Grazing in ICLS under no-tillage conditions may alter soil phosphorus (P) dynamics, because of changes in P budgets and distribution of P forms. The need to understand impacts on P dynamics is important because they can modify soil quality and, consequently, have implications for agriculture sustainability. The objective of this work was to compare the geochemical and biological forms of P (P-geo and P-bio) under long-term grazing, as well as to assess the mobility and lability of these nutrient forms in the soil profile. The experiment was established in  in an Oxisol and consisted of soybean (Glycine max L.) rotated to a winter cover crop of black oat (Avena strigosa Schreb.) and Italian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.) under no-tillage management. Treatments were two grazing heights (target of  and  cm) with young cattle and a non-grazed (NG) treatment. The experimental design was set up in completely randomized blocks with three replicates. Soil was sampled at the beginning of the experiment (May ) and again after six years (May of ) to study P fractionation at depths of  to ., . to ., . to ., . to , to  and  to  cm. After six years of ICLS, total P increased in the top  cm soil layer in both the grazed and non-grazed treatments. The P-geo and P-bio concentrations also increased in all treatments in the  to .-cm layer. Despite the greater P accumulation in the non-grazed no-till treatment, grazing maintained the P lability (labile + moderately labile) at the same level as in the long-term no-till treatment. The ICLS also promoted increases in labile P stocks, both in organic and inorganic forms. In spite of the higher P-geo stocks in the non-grazed treatment, P cycling was enhanced by grazing, such that soybean yields were similar in all treatments. Furthermore, the grazing treatment led to higher P budgets (surpluses) and more efficient P use, as represented by meat production in addition to the soybean production.", (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

To quantitatively determine the effects of sample statistics on entropy weight, a statistical analysis based on  stochastic samples was carried out to reveal the relationships of EW with sample mean, standard deviation (SD) and coefficient of variation (CV) in this study. Two modes (varied sample number mode and fixed sample number mode) under which the study was carried out were assumed. Sensitivity of EW to sample range was also investigated by perturbation approach. The study has shown that the correlations of EW with mean, SD and CV under varied sample number mode are insignificant, while under fixed sample number mode a significant quadratic relationship between EW and mean, and a significant linear relationship between EW and SD can be found. The relationship of EW with CV shows a check-mark-shaped pattern, and can be expressed by mixed quadratic and linear equations. The variation of sensitivity of EW to sample range can be expressed by quadratic equations. This study falls within the scope of sensitivity analysis, and is of great value in promoting the development of uncertainty theory and the research of sensitivity analysis associated with water quality assessment and other environmental studies such as environmental hazard evaluation, environmental risk assessment, environmental data interpretation and environmental policy making.",,"Wu, JH|Li, PY|Qian, H|Chen, J",ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES,entropy weight information entropy statistical analysis water quality assessment sensitivity analysis,10.1007/s12665-015-4208-y

In this study, one of them was used to predict the behaviour of a full-scale reactor. The model was calibrated and validated with non-synthetic influent using different operational conditions. A local sensitivity analysis was conducted to determine the most important operational and chemical model parameters. Based on the latter, the incident UV irradiation intensity and two kinetic rate constants were selected for mathematical estimation. In order to investigate changes of the NOM content over time, some time delay was considered between calibration and validation data collection. Hydrogen peroxide concentration, the decadic absorption coefficient at  nm (UVA(), as a surrogate for natural organic matter) and pH could be satisfactorily predicted during model validation using an independent data set. It was demonstrated that quick real-time calibration is an option at less controllable full-scale conditions. The reactivity of UVA() towards hydroxyl radicals did not show significant variations over time suggesting no need for frequent recalibration. Parameters that determine the initiation step, i.e. photolysis of hydrogen peroxide, have a large impact on most of the variables. Some reaction rate constants were also of importance, but nine kinetic constants did show absolutely no influence to one of the variables. Parameters related to UV shielding by NOM were of main importance. At the conditions used in this study, i.e. H()O() concentrations between . and  mM, hydraulic residence times between  and  s and alkalinity concentrations between . and  mM, competitive radiation absorption by NOM was more detrimental to the micro pollutant removal efficiency than hydroxyl radical scavenging. Hydrogen peroxide concentration was classified as a non-sensitive variable, in contrast to the concentration of a micro pollutant which showed to be very to extremely influential to many of the parameters. UV absorption as a NOM surrogate is a promising variable to be included in future models.

Bayesian parameter estimation is performed to calibrate the failure and replacement model based on a prior distribution inferred from three large water utilities in Switzerland. Multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) and scenario planning build the framework for evaluating  strategic rehabilitation alternatives under future uncertainty. Outcomes for three fundamental objectives (low costs, high reliability, and high intergenerational equity) are assessed. Exploitation of stochastic dominance concepts helps to identify twelve non-dominated alternatives and local sensitivity analysis of stakeholder preferences is used to rank them under four scenarios. Strategies with annual replacement of .-% of the network perform reasonably well under all scenarios. In contrast, the commonly used reactive replacement is not recommendable unless cost is the only relevant objective. Exemplified for a small Swiss water utility, this approach can readily be adapted to support strategic asset management for any utility size and based on objectives and preferences that matter to the respective decision makers.

However, there are surprisingly few such data available for Cu phytotoxicity in field-contaminated soils. Moreover, these studies differ from each other with regards to soil characteristics and experimental setups. This study aimed at more accurately estimating Cu phytotoxicity thresholds using field-collected agricultural soils (Entisols) from areas exposed to contamination from Cu mining. For this purpose, the exposure to Cu was assessed by measuring total soil Cu, soluble Cu, free Cu+ activity, and Cu in the plant aerial tissues. On the other hand, two bioassay durations (short-term and long-term), three plant species (Avena sativa L., Brassica rapa CrGC syn. Rbr, and Lolium perenne L), and five biometric endpoints (shoot length and weight, root length and weight, and number of seed pods) were considered. Overall plant growth was best predicted by total Cu content of the soil. Despite some confounding factors, it was possible to determine EC, EC and EC of total Cu in the soil. Brassica rapa was more sensitive than Avena sativa for all endpoints, while Lolium perenne was of intermediate sensitivity. For the short-term bioassay ( days for all three species), the averaged EC, EC and EC values of total soil Cu (in mg kg(-)) were , , and , respectively. For the long-term bioassay ( days for oat and  days for turnip), the averaged EC, EC and EC values of total soil Cu (in mg kr(-)) were , , and , respectively.

Using a calibrated rainfall-runoff(R-R) model, the baseline runoff scenario was first simulated. The R-R inputs (rainfall and temperature) were then perturbed using plausible delta-changes to produce simulated climate change runoff scenarios. Stochastic models of the runoff were developed and used to generate ensembles of both the current and climate-change-perturbed future runoff scenarios. The resulting runoff ensembles were used to force simulation models of the behaviour of the reservoir to produce 'populations' of required reservoir storage capacity to meet demands, and the performance. Comparing these parameters between the current and the perturbed provided the population of climate change effects which was then analysed to determine the variability in the impacts. The methodology was applied to the Pong reservoir on the Beas River in northern India. The reservoir serves irrigation and hydropower needs and the hydrology of the catchment is highly influenced by Himalayan seasonal snow and glaciers, and Monsoon rainfall, both of which are predicted to change due to climate change. The results show that required reservoir capacity is highly variable with a coefficient of variation (CV) as high as . as the future climate becomes drier. Of the performance indices, the vulnerability recorded the highest variability (CV up to .) while the volume-based reliability was the least variable. Such variabilities or uncertainties will, no doubt, complicate the development of climate change adaptation measures; however, knowledge of their sheer magnitudes as obtained in this study will help in the formulation of appropriate policy and technical interventions for sustaining and possibly enhancing water security for irrigation and other uses served by Pong reservoir.

Five treatments consisted of legumes (capello woolly pod vetch and field pea), two non-legume crops (Saia oat and Indian mustard), and a nil-crop treatment as control (CK) in southeastern Australia to investigate the effects of legume crops on the amount of N(fix,) which was estimated using a ()N natural abundance technique, and soil N pools, microbial biomass, microbial quotient, soil basal respiration, metabolic quotient (qCO()), net N mineralization rates, and substrate-induced respiration (SIR) using the MicroResp method.

The current paper presents a temporally coherent error identification method based on time-dependent multivariate spatial conditional simulations, which are conditioned on preceding simulations. A sensitivity analysis and real-world experiment are carried out within the hilly region of the Belgian Ardennes. Precipitation fields are simulated for pixels of  km x  km resolution. Uncertainty analyses in the simulated fields focus on () the number of previous simulation hours on which the new simulation is conditioned, () the advection speed of the rainfall event, () the size of the catchment considered, and () the rain gauge density within the catchment. The results for a sensitivity analysis show for typical advection speeds >  km h(-), no uncertainty is added in terms of across ensemble spread when conditioned on more than one or two previous hourly simulations. However, for the real-world experiment, additional uncertainty can still be added when conditioning on a larger number of previous simulations. This is because for actual precipitation fields, the dynamics exhibit a larger spatial and temporal variability. Moreover, by thinning the observation network with  %, the added uncertainty increases only slightly and the cross-validation shows that the simulations at the unobserved locations are unbiased. Finally, the first-order autocorrelation coefficients show clear temporal coherence in the time series of the areal precipitation using the time-dependent multivariate conditional simulations, which was not the case using the time-independent univariate conditional simulations. The presented work can be easily implemented within a hydrological calibration and data assimilation framework and can be used as an improvement over currently used simplistic approaches to perturb the interpolated point or spatially distributed precipitation estimates.",,"Rakovec, O|Hazenberg, P|Torfs, PJJF|Weerts, AH|Uijlenhoet, R",HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES,,10.5194/hess-16-3419-2012

The obtained parameter estimates are optimal in the sense that model fit would deteriorate to some degree if any of those estimates were changed. If a small change of a parameter estimate has large influence on model fit, such a parameter can be called highly influential, whereas if a substantial perturbation of a parameter estimate has negligible influence on model fit, that parameter can be called uninfluential. This is the idea of parameter influence. This article covers  approaches to quantifying parameter influence. One existing approach determines the direction vector of parameter perturbation causing maximum deterioration in model fit.

Recently, KF methods have shown potential for tracking CO plumes injected in deep geologic formations. Such real-time estimation would serve as an early warning system for leakage incidents. However, for the large number of unknowns of such large systems, KF methods are impractical, because updating the huge state covariance matrix is computationally expensive. Low rank approximation methods have been devised to overcome this problem; these methods assume a low rank of the covariance matrix, which they approximate by smaller matrices. The approximation error is small for smooth functions, but may be larger for more complex physical problems, potentially leading to filter divergence and inaccurate state estimates. We present the Spectral Kalman Filter (SpecKF), a new algorithm that utilizes the exact covariance matrix. Thus it avoids the approximation error and does so in a computationally efficient way, which is specially important for systems with large numbers of unknowns. The computational speed-up of the SpecKF is achieved by updating cross-covariance matrices instead of the larger covariance matrices. The benefit can be considerable, especially in large systems, because the computational complexity of the SpecKF scales with the number of measurements, as opposed to the effective rank of the covariance matrix in low-rank KFs or the number of ensemble members in ensemble methods. We investigate the accuracy and performance of the SpecKF for a diffusion problem with random perturbations, and for a more complex case of CO injection in a homogeneous two-dimensional domain. Our results show that the SpecKF reduces greatly the computational cost compared to the original KF algorithm, and that it can provide higher accuracy than the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) with the same or even smaller computational cost. Finally, we discuss some approaches that can be used with the SpecKF for approximating the uncertainty of the final state estimates. (C) ", Elsevier Ltd.

For operational implementation of TSEB, however, it is often difficult to obtain representative air temperature data that are compatible with the LST retrievals, which may themselves have residual errors due to atmospheric and emissivity corrections. To address this issue, two different strategies in applying the TSEB model without requiring local air temperature data were tested over a typical Mediterranean agricultural area using a set of high-resolution multispectral airborne remote sensing images. Alleviating the need for accurate local air temperature data as input, these two approaches estimate the surface-to-air temperature gradient that drives the sensible heat flux by directly exploiting the information available in the image. The two approaches indude: ) a scene-based internal calibration (TSEB-IC) procedure that estimates air temperature over a well-watered and fully vegetated pixel in the LST image, and ) a disaggregation scheme (DisALEXI) that uses air temperature estimates from a time-differential coupled TSEB-atmospheric boundary layer model of atmosphere-land exchange (ALEXI). A comparison of the air temperatures modeled by TSEB-IC and DisALEXI with in situ weather station observations shows good agreement, with average differences on the order of  K. comparable with the uncertainties in the remotely sensed surface temperature maps. Surface fluxes estimated by each method agree well with micro-meteorological measurements acquired over an olive orchard within the aircraft imaging domain. In comparison with fluxes generated with TSEB using local measurements of air temperature, instantaneous fluxes from these alternative methods show good spatial agreement, with differences of less than low m(-) across the domain. Finally, a sensitivity analysis of the three models, performed by introducing artificial errors into the model inputs, demonstrates that the DisALEXI and TSEB-IC approaches are relatively insensitive to errors in absolute surface temperature calibration, while turbulent fluxes from TSEB applications using local air temperature measurements show sensitivity of approximately  W m(-) per degree temperature perturbation. This highlights the value of both internal calibration and timedifferential estimation of the surface-to-air temperature gradient within a surface energy balance framework (c)  Elsevier Inc.

Local sensitivity analysis is usually performed only after the optimisation run to study the behaviour of the objective function in the neighbourhood of the optimum.

Most numerical models still provide no information on prediction uncertainty. This gap between theory and practice is due largely to the excessive computational demands of available numerical methods for solving stochastic problems. The two primary alternatives, Monte Carlo and classical perturbation methods, both require solving large numbers of equations on fine grid spacings that are smaller than the log conductivity correlation length, no matter how smooth the mean flow and variance dynamics of interest are. This results in computational times that are many orders-of-magnitude greater than those required for conventional deterministic simulations. In addition, classical perturbation methods need much more real memory than comparable deterministic simulations. In this paper, we present an innovative approach for stochastic groundwater modeling-one that finally allows taking advantage of the scale disparity between the mean distributions and small-scale process. The new approach, which is called the nonstationary spectral method, implicitly separates the problem into rapidly varying random (stationary) part and a slowly varying deterministic (nonstationary) part and only the latter needs to be solved numerically. A general analysis and a specific numerical example both demonstrate that the nonstationary spectral method is much more efficient than the available alternatives. The methodological innovation dramatically increases the size and range of the problems that can be solved using stochastic methods and represents a major step forward in our effort to make stochastic uncertainty analysis a routine part of groundwater modeling.

A novel feature of DECM is the adoption of an occupancy pattern model which is derived from the household employment status data. We believe this modification has significantly improved the accuracy of the estimation in space heating energy use. At national level, the model estimation of carbon emissions and gas and electricity consumptions are respectively .%, .% and .% higher than the national statistics. At the sub-national level (Local Authority), two methods are used to produce estimations: one based on dwelling type and the other based on socio-economic class. For both methods, the correlations between the model estimations and the government records are statistically significant and substantial (all r(s) > . and ps<.). According to the results, it can be inferred that over % of the variance in dwelling energy consumptions and carbon emissions can be accounted for by dwelling type and the socio-economic class of households. The paper presents a local sensitivity analysis which examines the effects of various building fabric and service system parameters on the modelled average carbon emissions per dwelling. Based on the findings, a set of predictive charts are developed which can provide rapid estimations of the effect of various energy efficiency measures on dwelling energy consumptions and carbon emissions taking into account the potential rebound effect. In summary, this paper shows that the DECM model can be a useful tool to assist the formation of energy efficiency policies at both national and local levels. (C) ", Elsevier Ltd.

One common problem in applying these techniques is the highly non-linear relationship between the distribution of the fluid dynamic production data and the petrophysical parameters, which frequently have a non-stationary character. This paper proposes a multi-scale optimization approach for geostatistical history matching that aims at tackling the problem inherent to the convergence of static models with complex spatial patterns toward the reservoir production observations. The proposed methodology couples adaptive stochastic optimization and direct sequential simulation with local anisotropy correction as the core of image transforming in a twofold procedure: a global optimization stage and a refining optimization stage. The former consists of optimizing the trend model of anisotropy defined over the space of geological parameters. The latter achieves the local refining optimization based on best individual well production matches. Overall, large-scale trend model parameters are tuned with adaptive stochastic optimization followed by the local refining optimization across multiple realizations using a regional image perturbation algorithm. A deltaic reservoir example illustrates the application of the proposed methodology. The deltaic channel pattern is fairly well reproduced and the optimization procedures allow the match of static models' dynamic responses to historical production observations.",,"Caeiro, MH|Demyanov, V|Soares, A",MATHEMATICAL GEOSCIENCES,geostatistics direct sequential simulation sampling optimization deltaic reservoir,10.1007/s11004-015-9591-0

The design objective is to minimize the sound power of the vibrating composite macrostructure that is assumed to be constructed by periodic micro unit cell filled up by two kinds of prescribed isotropic materials. The SIMP based bi-material interpolation model is employed at the micro-scale and the design variable is the relative material volume density of the micro unit cell. A design process consisting of the uncertainty analysis and vibro-acoustic microstructural topology optimization is proposed and implemented. The influences of different combination values of the normalized variables corresponding to the uncertainty parameters on the design results are investigated. Numerical examples show that in the vibro-acoustic microstructural design the uncertainty of the excitation frequency may play a very important role. It is also shown that when the normalized variable corresponding to the random excitation frequency takes the higher value, the optimum microstructural topology may not be so sensitive to perturbation of the loading direction.

This is important both to quantify the relative importance of the uncertainty sources, a necessary step toward the reduction of the overall uncertainty, and to adequately support decision-making processes. Here we consider a new uncertainty estimation method, the Perturbance Moment Point Estimate Method (PMM), based on a discrete representation of the probability distribution functions of the stochastic input variables. We apply the method to a geomorphological model of the hydrologic response of the Brenta River (North-East Italy) and compare its performance with those from a traditional, more computationally-intensive, Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) approach. We show that the PMM method is significantly more efficient in terms of computational time and offers an accuracy that is appropriate for hydrological applications. We also show how the use of Point Estimate Methods allows the analysis of the effects of individual sources of uncertainty without the need for additional simulations. The PMM application shows that for the particular basin under study, the uncertainty in calibrated model parameters is a major contributor to the overall uncertainty which is not necessarily a novelty in the hydrologic literature. However, we also find that the imperfect knowledge of forcing inputs and particularly measurement error in rainfall observations plays a comparably important role and induces, in our study, a large uncertainty in the estimated discharge. Finally, we observe a somewhat compensative interaction among different sources of uncertainty, which may lead to an overall model uncertainty that differs from the sum of the uncertainties associated with the individual sources.

We use the model to examine the effects of popular control strategies and demographic perturbations on the invasive weed garlic mustard (Alliaria petiolata). We find that seasonality is a major factor in harvest outcomes, because population dynamics may depend significantly on both the season of management and the season of observation. Strategies that reduce densities in one season can drive increases in another, with strategies giving positive sensitivities of density in the target seasons leading to compensatory effects that invasive species managers should avoid.

Many tissues recover and change shape during thawing which prevents a clear picture of ice formation and how individual cells might have responded to this form of stress. Cryo-sectioning and related techniques, while providing valuable information, only allow a two-dimensional view of what is in fact, a three-dimensional phenomenon. In this study, an established freeze-fixation protocol was used in conjunction with histology to visualize empty spaces or voids created by ice within crowns of oat. Images of sections were aligned and background color was cleared to provide D visualization of voids that had formed within tissues as a result of freezing. Reconstruction in  dimensions revealed that ice had formed continuously in the roots but terminated at the root-shoot junction. This supports previous research that a barrier exists at the base of the crown in freezing tolerant cultivars of winter cereals. In addition, ice-induced voids within the crown were narrow and vertically inclined; they did not form large spherical shapes as had previously been suggested from two-dimensional analysis. Within apical regions of the crown, voids always formed just below the epidermis on what would eventually become the lower surface of the leaf. The D structure of these formations resembled a curtain with a termination point at the top of the transition zone and which extended continuously into the leaves. These results suggest that multiple mechanisms must be operative concurrently for the crown to survive.

Up to now, such a claimed connection of TIR emission with seismic activity has been considered with some caution by scientific community mainly for the insufficiency of the validation data-sets and the scarce importance attached by those authors to other causes (e.g. meteorological) that, rather than seismic activity, could be responsible for the observed TIR signal fluctuations. A robust satellite data analysis technique (RAT) has been recently proposed which, thanks to a well-founded definition of TIR anomaly, seems to be able to identify anomalous space-time TIR signal transients even in very variable observational (satellite view angle, land topography and coverage, etc.) and natural (e.g. meteorological) conditions. Its possible application to satellite TIR surveys in seismically active regions has been already tested in the case of several earthquakes (Irpinia:  November , Athens:  September , Izmit:  August ) of magnitude higher than . by using a validation/confutation approach, devoted to verify the presence/absence of anomalous space-time TIR transients in the presence/absence of seismic activity. In these cases, a magnitude threshold (generally M<) was arbitrarily chosen in order to identify seismically unperturbed periods for confutation purposes. In this work,  medium-low magnitude (<Mb<.) earthquakes which occurred in Greece and Turkey have been analyzed in order to verify if, even in these cases, anomalous TIR transients can be observed.

Consequently, their impact on agriculture is escalating which raises the need for evidence informed preventative strategies. We surveyed arable fields for autumn staging common cranes in an area surrounding a wetland reserve in Sweden. We assessed the following factors in relation to the probability of cranes being present on fields: crop stage, crop type, distance to roost site, time of day, field size and time since harvest. Stubble fields had the highest probability of crane presence, progressively decreasing through grassland and grazing grounds, bare soil to growing crop. A stubble field at  km from a roost site had a predicted probability (% CI) of hosting cranes of . (.-.). The probability of cranes visiting a field was linearly and negatively related to distance to the roost site. For example, the probability of crane presence increased from . (.-.) to . (.-.) when distance decreased from  to  km. At stubble fields, the probability of crane presence decreased with time since harvest and was highest for barley with progressively lower probability on wheat and oat. Illustrative scenario predictions developed from the models demonstrated that probability of crane presence could be high, . (.-.), if all favorable factors were combined (e.g. barley stubble,  day after harvest,  km from roost site). Given the existing framework of international conventions and prohibition of culling, there is a need for preventative strategies to reduce crop damage. Based on our results, such strategies should focus on providing cereal stubbles as diversionary fields, especially close to wetland roosting sites. Stubble field availability can be achieved by careful crop rotation planning.

These experiments indicate that the adjoint model is, despite the many uncertainties, generally capable to optimize sensitive parameters and carbon fluxes in the euphotic zone. The best fit regional parameters predict a global net primary production of  Pg C yr(-), which lies within the range suggested by Antoine et al. ().

78,WOS:000299195200029,2011,Modelling of cation concentrations in the outflow of NaNO3 percolation experiments through Boom Clay cores,EXCHANGE SELECTIVITY,"A laboratory percolation experiment was performed to study the effect of a NaNO plume on the Boom Clay. In this experiment, Boom Clay cores were consecutively percolated with Boom Clay pore water and Boom Clay pore water to which NaNO was added. The concentration of NaNO in the pore water was increased stepwise (., ., and  M NaNO). The concentrations of Na, K, Ca, Mg and Sr in the eluted water were measured. After every switch of the NaNO concentration, the concentration profiles of K, Ca, Mg, and Sr showed a sharp rise, followed by a slow decrease. It was hypothesised that the cation elution curves are mainly determined by cation exchange processes. Reactive coupled transport modelling with the PHREEQC- code was used to describe the experimentally observed elution curves for the cations. Solute transport and water-clay interaction mechanisms, namely cation exchange, were accounted for in the model. Cation exchange parameters (cation exchange capacity and selectivity coefficients) previously determined on non-perturbed Boom Clay (De Craen et al., ) were used. A sensitivity analysis was performed to assess the influence of these parameter values on the goodness of the model to describe the experimental data. The model could fairly well describe the experimentally observed cation concentrations in the eluted water, confirming that cation exchange is indeed the dominant mechanism regulating the cation elution in the percolation experiments.

The bird cherry-oat aphid, Rhopalosiphum padi, is a global pest of cereals and vector of yellow dwarf viruses that cause significant crop losses in cereals. R. padi exhibits both sexual and parthenogenetic reproduction, alternating between crops and other host plants. In Australia, only parthenogenesis occurs due to the absence of the primary host, thus the aphid continuously cycles from grasses to cereals, allowing for continuous virus acquisition and transmission. We have reviewed the potential impact of future climate projections on R. padi population dynamics, persistence, abundance, dispersal and migration events as well as the interactions between vector, virus, crop and environment, all of which are critical to the behaviour and development of the vector and its ability to transmit the virus.

A detailed analysis of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the stochastic system Jacobian is conducted, which provides a relationship between the PC representation of the stochastic Jacobian and the Jacobian of the Galerkin form of the stochastic system. The analysis is then used to guide the application of a simplified CSP formalism that is based on relating the slow and fast manifolds of the uncertain system to those of a nominal deterministic system.

Empirical orthogonal functions (EOF) are used to formulate both spatial perturbations to initial conditions and space-time wind forcing perturbations, namely in the form of a superposition of modal components with uniformly distributed random amplitudes. The forward deterministic HYbrid Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM) is used to propagate input uncertainties in the Gulf of Mexico (GoM) in spring , during the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, and to generate the ensemble of model realizations based on which PC surrogate models are constructed for both localized and field quantities of interest (QoIs), focusing specifically on sea surface height (SSH) and mixed layer depth (MLD). These PC surrogate models are constructed using basis pursuit denoising methodology, and their performance is assessed through various statistical measures. A global sensitivity analysis is then performed to quantify the impact of individual modes as well as their interactions. It shows that the local SSH at the edge of the GoM main current-the Loop Current-is mostly sensitive to perturbations of the initial conditions affecting the current front, whereas the local MLD in the area of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill is more sensitive to wind forcing perturbations. At the basin scale, the SSH in the deep GoM is mostly sensitive to initial condition perturbations, while over the shelf it is sensitive to wind forcing perturbations. On the other hand, the basin MLD is almost exclusively sensitive to wind perturbations. For both quantities, the two sources of uncertainty have limited interactions.

The composition of oil samples used in dispersion experiments was systematically manipulated by varying the relative concentrations of the saturates, aromatics, resins, and asphaltenes (SARA) fractions. Forward stepwise linear regression was used with a generalized linear model that included main effects and two-factor interactions to evaluate the effects of oil composition on chemical dispersion. Limited sensitivity analysis was used to determine whether the significant effects were strongly dependent on the specific combination of responses observed in these experiments or insensitive to small changes within the range of variation that was observed. The concentration of the aromatics fraction and the saturates-resins interaction exerted statistically significant, positive effects on dispersion effectiveness (p < .). Regardless of composition, the droplet-size distributions observed in these experiments were multimodal consisting of small-(<  mu m), medium-(- mu m), and large-sized (>  mu m) droplets. Higher concentrations of the saturates fraction favored the entrainment of floating oil as small and medium-sized droplets, whereas the aromatics-asphaltenes interaction reduced the amount of oil present as small droplets.

Monte Carlo sensitivity analysis scheme with fifty simulations is established based on the Nested Air Quality Prediction Model System (NAQPMS). At every simulation, each of the eleven precursor emissions is perturbed with a distinct set of perturbations. The sensitivities of ozone to emissions are identified by multiple linear regressions. The stability of sensitivity results is validated by two experiments with standard deviations of log-normal perturbations set as % and % respectively. The sensitivity results suggest that the current high surface ozone is strongly stimulated by NMVOC emissions. Among NMVOC emissions, formaldehyde, ethylene and olefins emissions present the greatest impacts on ozone. On the other hand, NOx emissions have a strong inhibitory effect on ozone formation, even after % NOx emission reduction. This indicates that the current ozone formation in Beijing is under NOx-saturated conditions. A transition of ozone formation is observed from NOx-saturated to NOx-limited sensitivity behavior with a % reduction of NOx emissions. This study gives the implication that abatement of the four NMVOC types mentioned above could be efficient on reducing the high levels of surface ozone in central urban Beijing, while inadequate abatement in NOx emissions probably induces reverse effects.

Least squares regression methods explicitly assume Gaussian residuals, and the assumption leads to Gaussian likelihood functions, model parameters, and model predictions. While the Bayesian methods do not explicitly require the Gaussian assumption, Gaussian residuals are widely used. This paper shows that the residuals of the reactive transport model are non-Gaussian, heteroscedastic, and correlated in time; characterizing them requires using a generalized likelihood function such as the formal generalized likelihood function developed by Schoups and Vrugt (). For the surface complexation model considered in this study for simulating uranium reactive transport in groundwater, parametric uncertainty is quantified using the least squares regression methods and Bayesian methods with both Gaussian and formal generalized likelihood functions. While the least squares methods and Bayesian methods with Gaussian likelihood function produce similar Gaussian parameter distributions, the parameter distributions of Bayesian uncertainty quantification using the formal generalized likelihood function are non-Gaussian. In addition, predictive performance of formal generalized likelihood function is superior to that of least squares regression and Bayesian methods with Gaussian likelihood function. The Bayesian uncertainty quantification is conducted using the differential evolution adaptive metropolis (DREAM((ZS))) algorithm; as a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method, it is a robust tool for quantifying uncertainty in groundwater reactive transport models. For the surface complexation model, the regression-based local sensitivity analysis and Morris-and DREAM((ZS))-based global sensitivity analysis yield almost identical ranking of parameter importance.

In this paper, an automatic calibration framework for the distributed hydrological model HYDROTEL is proposed. The calibration procedure was performed for three watersheds characterized with different hydroclimatological conditions: the Sassandra located in Ivory Coast, Africa, and the Montmorency and Beaurivage watersheds located in Quebec (Canada). Results of one-a-time (OAT) sensitivity analysis showed that the order of the most sensitive parameters differs for each watershed. Thus, the sensitivity depends on the hydroclimatic and physiographic characteristics of the watersheds. Co-linearity indices showed that all model parameters were identifiable, that is, none of the studied parameters could be explained by a combination of the other parameters. Following these findings, an automatic calibration was run. Results indicated there was good agreement between simulated and measured streamflows at the outlet of each watershed; Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) ranging between . and . and R ranging from . to .. When comparing NSE and R values obtained using a process-oriented, multiple-objective, manual calibration strategy, a slight increase in model efficiency was reached with the automatic calibration procedure (.% for NSE and .% for R) improving predictions of peak flows for the Montmorency and Beaurivage watersheds (temperate climate conditions) and flows beyond the rainfall season in the Sassandra watershed.

This approach is on the basis of an innovative combination of Karhunen-Loeve decomposition, polynomial expansion, and perturbation methods. The random log-transformed hydraulic conductivity field (lnK(S)) is first expanded into a series in terms of orthogonal Gaussian standard random variables with their coefficients obtained as the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the covariance function of lnK(S). Next, head h is decomposed as a perturbation expansion series Sigma h((m)), where h((m)) represents the mth-order head term with respect to the standard deviation of lnK(S). Then h((m)) is further expanded into a polynomial series of m products of orthogonal Gaussian standard random variables whose coefficients h(i),((m))(i),...,i(m) are deterministic and solved sequentially from low to high expansion orders using MODFLOW- . Finally, the statistics of head and flux are computed using simple algebraic operations on h(i),((m))(i),...,i(m) .

In this study, the fate of micropollutants of four different classes was simulated in a conventional activated sludge plant using a bioreactor micropollutant fate model coupled to a settler model. The latter was based on the Burger-Diehl model extended for the first time to include micropollutant fate processes. Calibration of model parameters was completed by matching modelling results with full-scale measurements (i.e. including aqueous and particulate phase concentrations of micropollutants) obtained from a -day sampling campaign. Modelling results showed that further biodegradation takes place in the sludge blanket of the settler for the highly biodegradable caffeine, underlining the need for a reactive settler model. The adopted Monte Carlo based calibration approach also provided an overview of the model's global sensitivity to the parameters. This analysis showed that for each micropollutant and according to the dominant fate process, a different set of one or more parameters had a significant impact on the model fit, justifying the selection of parameter subsets for model calibration. A dynamic local sensitivity analysis was also performed with the calibrated parameters.

This invokes that uncertainty in measurement should be viewed as central to remote sensing. In this study, the uncertainty associated with water stages derived from a single SAR image for the Alzette (G.D. of Luxembourg)  flood is assessed using a stepped GLUE procedure. Main uncertain input factors to the SAR processing chain for estimating water stages include geolocation accuracy, spatial filter window size, image thresholding value, DEM vertical precision and the number of river cross sections at which water stages are estimated. Initial results show that even with plausible parameter values uncertainty in water stages over the entire river reach is . m on average. Adding spatially distributed field water stages to the GLUE analysis following a one-at-a-time approach helps to considerably reduce SAR water stage uncertainty (. m on average) thereby identifying appropriate value ranges for each uncertain SAR water stage processing factor. For the GLUE analysis a Nash-like efficiency criterion adapted to spatial data is proposed whereby acceptable SAR model simulations are required to outperform a simpler regression model based on the field-surveyed average river bed gradient. Weighted CDFs for all factors based on the proposed efficiency criterion allow the generation of reliable uncertainty quantile ranges and D maps that show the uncertainty associated with SAR-derived water stages. The stepped GLUE procedure demonstrated that not all field data collected are necessary to achieve maximum constraining. A possible efficient way to decide on relevant locations at which to sample in the field is proposed. It is also suggested that the resulting uncertainty ranges and flood extent or depth maps may be used to evaluate D or D flood inundation models in terms of water stages, depths or extents. For this, the extended GLUE approach, which copes with the presence of uncertainty in the observed data, may be adopted. (C) ", Elsevier Ltd.

Besides traditional, already well developed methods - such as first order perturbation theory or Monte Carlo sampling - Polynomial Chaos Expansion (PCE) has been given a growing emphasis in recent years due to its simple application and good performance. This paper presents new developments of the research done at TU Delft on such Polynomial Chaos (PC) techniques. Our work is focused on the Non-Intrusive Spectral Projection (NISP) approach and adaptive methods for building the PCE of responses of interest. Recent efforts resulted in a new adaptive sparse grid algorithm designed for estimating the PC coefficients. The algorithm is based on Gerstner's procedure for calculating multidimensional integrals but proves to be computationally significantly cheaper, while at the same it retains a similar accuracy as the original method. More importantly the issue of basis adaptivity has been investigated and two techniques have been implemented for constructing the sparse PCE of quantities of interest. Not using the traditional full PC basis set leads to further reduction in computational time since the high order grids necessary for accurately estimating the near zero expansion coefficients of polynomial basis vectors not needed in the PCE can be excluded from the calculation. Moreover the sparse PC representation of the response is easier to handle when used for sensitivity analysis or uncertainty propagation due to the smaller number of basis vectors. The developed grid and basis adaptive methods have been implemented in Matlab as the Fully Adaptive Non-Intrusive Spectral Projection (FANISP) algorithm and were tested on four analytical problems. These show consistent good performance both in terms of the accuracy of the resulting PC representation of quantities and the computational costs associated with constructing the sparse PCE. Basis adaptivity also seems to make the employment of PC techniques possible for problems with a higher number of input parameters (-), alleviating a well known limitation of the traditional approach. The prospect of larger scale applicability and the simplicity of implementation makes such adaptive PC algorithms particularly appealing for the sensitivity and uncertainty analysis of complex systems and legacy codes.", (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

This method requires detailed measurements of depth changes and cumulative evaporation during - to -d periods. Quantifying the uncertainty surrounding the measurements is crucial if data from seepage tests are used to determine if lagoons are meeting engineering specifications and operating within regulatory guidelines. Uncertainty analyses, using a % confidence interval, were applied to field data collected during studies of animal waste lagoons in Kansas and Oklahoma. Changes in depth were measured with float-based recorders and evaporation was estimated from meteorological observations. Results showed that rate changes in depth could be measured to within +/-. mm d(-) or better when wind speeds at the start and end of the test were less than  m s(-). Uncertainty in evaporation was the most significant factor affecting the seepage estimate, and surface temperature and relative humidity were the main sources of imprecision in the evaporation calculations. Evaporation could be estimated to within  to %, with the largest uncertainty occurring during windy conditions. Uncertainty in the calculated seepage rate increased as evaporation increased. When evaporation rates are low (e.g., < mm d(-)), seepage can be estimated to within +/-. rum d(-) with % confidence. A precision of +/-. rum d(-) is possible when research-grade instruments are deployed under favorable weather conditions. A measurement duration of  d is adequate for most water balance tests. In many cases, precision of the water balance technique will be sufficient in determining if a working lagoon is within regulatory guidelines.",,"Ham, JM",JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY,,10.2134/jeq2002.1370

Case Study of Limestone Quarry Mokra,POST MINING SITES SPONTANEOUS SUCCESSION TECHNICAL RECLAMATION CENTRAL-EUROPE RESTORATION LANDSCAPE LAYER HEAPS BIOTA TOOL,"The role of soil properties for vegetation development during early spontaneous succession was studied in a limestone quarry Mokra (south Moravia, Czech Republic). In particular, we would like to detect the soil environment features supporting the swards formation of expansive reed grass (Calamagrostis epigejos), which is able to arrest a succession process. Research was conducted along postmined quarry benches, where natural recovery took place. We examined water-air regime, soil organic carbon (SOC) content, total nitrogen content (Ntot), content of available calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), potassium (K), phosphorus (P), soil reaction (pH), and soil texture of soil samples collected separately from assemblages with abundant reed grass and without them, usually with the occurrence of tall oat grass (Arrhenatherum elatius). A multivariate statistical approach revealed the fact that soil texture, SOC, Ntot, and water-air regime were statistically significant for the vegetation types. Reed grass prefers fine grained soils with higher amount of clay and silt particles, whereas assemblages without abundant presence of this species settled coarse grained soils with higher sand or skeleton content. High SOC and Ntot values were also associated with sites covered with reed grass. Therefore, using these variables as a measure of recovery success in early succession might be a problem.",,"Cihlarova, H|Koutecky, T|Hladky, J|Rosicka, Z|Botkova, K|Brtnicky, M|Kynicky, J",ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE,limestone quarry natural recovery reed grass soil properties spontaneous succession,10.1089/ees.2016.0505

The water quality model incorporates a rainfall-runoff sub-model and a sediment load estimation sub-model, and is calibrated against hydrologic and water quality data from the Moruya River catchment in southeast Australia. The tested methods, One-at-A-Time (OAT), Morris Method (MM) and Regional SA (RSA) are found to be complementary, and help to characterise the behaviour of the water quality model. The most important parameters are plant stress threshold (f), coefficient of evapotranspiration (e), catchment moisture threshold (d), in decreasing order, indicating that sediment and nutrient loads are more sensitive to parameters that affect the magnitude of flows than those (v(s), tau(q), tau(s)) that control the timing and shape of the peak in a time series. But this application shows a need to be flexible in the use of different SA techniques. RSA is more appropriate for complex models where system nonlinearities and parameter interactions are more likely to be important. The RSA suggests that f and v(s) have strong interactions in the influence on nitrogen estimation. This study is also valuable for future uncertainty analysis, by separating the source of uncertainty of model parameters from the uncertainty in the model inputs. (C) ", Elsevier Ltd.

These dynamics are challenging for land cover classifications on the one hand, but deliver crucial information that can be used to improve the classifiers performance on the other hand. Since up to date mapping of crops is crucial to assess the impact of agricultural land use on the ecosystems, an accurate and complete classification of crop types is of high importance. In the presented study, a new multitemporal data based classification approach was developed that incorporates knowledge about the phenological changes on crop lands. It identifies phenological sequence patterns (PSP) of the crop types based on a dense stack of Sentinel- data and accurate information about the plant's phenology. The performance of the developed methodology has been tested for two different vegetation seasons using over  ground truth fields located in northern Germany. The results showed that a dense time series of Sentinel- images allowed for high classification accuracies of grasslands, maize, canola, sugar beets and potatoes (F-score above .) using PSP as well as standard (Random Forest and Maximum Likelihood) classification method. The PSP approach clearly outperformed standard methods for cereal crops, especially for spring barley where the F-score varied between zero and . for standard approaches, while PSP achieved values as high as . and . for both vegetation seasons. The PSP based approach also outperformed for oat, winter barley and rye. Furthermore, the PSP classification is more resilient to differences in farming management and conditions of growth since it takes information about each crop types' growing stage and its growing period into consideration. The results also indicate, that the PSP approach was more sensitive to subtle changes such as the proportion of weeds within a field.", (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Critical civil infrastructure facilities, including wastewater treatment, transportation, and energy, need site-specific flood contingency plans that reflect the effects of changing climate. This study developed a sensitivity analysis method to assess future flood risk by estimating flood frequency under conditions of higher sea level and streamflow response to increased precipitation intensity. The method was applied to an ungauged location on a tidal estuary in the Mid-Atlantic region as a case study. One-dimensional (D) unsteady flow analysis using a hydraulic analysis software developed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers was used to predict discharge and water surface elevation along the estuary reach, subject to prescribed boundary conditions of upstream discharge and downstream water surface elevation. A current-climate flood-depth frequency curve was estimated for the study site based on simulations of high-flow events in the years for which simultaneous upstream and downstream records were available. The simulations were repeated, applying additive water surface elevation (WSEL) perturbations at the downstream boundary (to represent anticipated sea-level rise) and multiplicative event discharge perturbations at the upstream boundary (to represent anticipated change in watershed hydrology). The perturbations were applied separately and together. Revised flood-depth frequency curves were calculated for each set of perturbations. For this location, the % annual exceedance (-year) WSEL is .m (.ft) higher, and the .% annual exceedance (-year) WSEL is m (.ft) higher, than current climate in the worst-case scenario, .m (ft) of sea-level rise and a % increase in event discharge. For that scenario, the current % exceedance (-year) WSEL has a % probability of exceedance (.year). The results indicate that the effects of the upstream and downstream changes are not additive.

The experimental variables were: the type of soil (loamy sand and sandy loam), degree of soil pollution with zinc from  to  mg Zn+ kg(-) d.m., and plant species (oat, spring rape and yellow lupine). Samples of soil were tested to determine the activity of dehydrogenases, catalase and urease as well as its physicochemical properties. Based on the enzymatic activity of soil and the dry matter of harvested plants, the resistance of enzymes and each of the crops was determined to excessive amounts of zinc in soil with different grain-size distribution. It was concluded that zinc contamination significantly inhibited the activity of dehydrogenases, catalase and urease. With respect to their sensitivity to zinc, the enzymes were arranged in the following order: dehydrogenases > urease > catalase. The plant species and grain-size distribution of soil determined the resistance of the enzymes to zinc pollution. Dehydrogenases were most resistant to zinc in soil cropped with oat, urease in soil under spring rape and catalase in soil sown with yellow lupine. Dehydrogenases and urease were more resistant to the adverse influence of zinc in sandy loam than in loamy sand, contrary to catalase, which was less vulnerable in loamy sand than in sandy loam. Tolerance of plants to zinc pollution proved to be a species-specific characteristic.

These services have rarely been evaluated in yield or monetary terms at farm level. We have examined the degree to which ground-living natural enemies of the bird cherry-oat aphid (Rhopalosiphum padi (L.)) reduced aphid abundance and influenced barley yields on ten commercial farms in central Sweden. On average, ground-living natural enemies of pests increased barley yields by  kg/ha.

The probe uses a timber block inserted into the wall, relying upon the measurable moisture variances of the timber and relating this to the surrounding straw. The probes are designed to be used in pairs of varying length, taking measurements at different depths to give an estimate of the moisture gradient through the wall. In order to properly calibrate this device, a full set of sorption and desorption isotherms were established for both Oat and Wheat straw and three different timber species.

Guangdong Province, as one of the low-carbon pilot provinces, has also paid great attention to the building of LCC. However, currently Guangdong province, or even China as a whole, has no official evaluation system in place which can be employed to evaluate the degree of low carbon of urban LCC. This paper aimed to establish a system for evaluating the urban LCC of Guangdong Province based on their actual situations. The system divided the evaluation into six categories, applied the SMART criteria to select suitable indices, and set the reference values for two zones, i.e., the Pearl River Delta zone (PRD) and the non-PRD zone. Monte Carlo and AHP were combined for the calculation of index weights, thus ensuring that the weight judgment matrixes could all pass the consistency check. In addition, this paper also laid down detailed evaluation regulations to improve the operability of this system and guarantee its wide application and better generalization. Finally, one typical urban community was selected to test the operability of this system, and the One At -a-Time (OAT) method was used to analyze the sensitivity of each index and explore the degree of influence of these indices on evaluation results. The results showed that three indicators corresponding to green building percentage, new energy vehicles percentage and low carbon public transportation had the highest sensitivity. After field test evaluation, the evaluation system was found to have strong operability, and a high accessibility to indicator data. This system cannot only be used as a tool by the Provincial People's Government of Guangdong to evaluate the construction progress and degree of low carbon in LCC, but can also provide a reference point and experience for the Chinese government to draw upon in establishing the evaluation system of LCC at a national level.

The shake table tests were designed so as to damage the building progressively through several historical seismic motions reproduced on the shake table. A sensitivity-based finite element (FE) model updating method was used to identify damage in the building. The estimation uncertainty in the damage identification results was observed to be significant, which motivated the authors to perform, through numerical simulation, an uncertainty analysis on a set of damage identification results. This study investigates systematically the performance of FE model updating for damage identification. The damaged structure is simulated numerically through a change in stiffness in selected regions of a FE model of the shear wall test structure. The uncertainty of the identified damage (location and extent) due to variability of five input factors is quantified through analysis-of-variance (ANOVA) and meta-modeling. These five input factors are: (-) level of uncertainty in the (identified) modal parameters of each of the first three longitudinal modes, () spatial density of measurements (number of sensors), and () mesh size in the FE model used in the FE model updating procedure (a type of modeling error). A full factorial design of experiments is considered for these five input factors. In addition to ANOVA and meta-modeling, this study investigates the one-at-a-time sensitivity analysis of the identified damage to the level of uncertainty in the identified modal parameters of the first three longitudinal modes. The results of this investigation demonstrate that the level of confidence in the damage identification results obtained through FE model updating, is a function of not only the level of uncertainty in the identified modal parameters, but also choices made in the design of experiments (e.g., spatial density of measurements) and modeling errors (e.g., mesh size). Therefore, the experiments can be designed so that the more influential input factors (to the total uncertainty/variability of the damage identification results) are set at optimum levels so as to yield more accurate damage identification results.",,"Moaveni, B|Conte, JP|Hemez, FM",COMPUTER-AIDED CIVIL AND INFRASTRUCTURE ENGINEERING,,10.1111/j.1467-8667.2008.00589.x

Decrease in dry matter (DM) production of roots ( %) and shoots ( %) was also observed in the highest Cu concentration. Plants without P addition, regardless of Cu concentration, also had lower root (%) and shoot ( %) DM production. P addition in soil and its increased concentration reduced root anatomical changes and stimulated plant DM production.

The formation is composed of various materials, and distributions of conductivity and chemical sorption coefficient within each material are heterogeneous. The random distributions of materials in the formation are characterized by an indicator function. The conductivity and chemical sorption coefficient fields in each material are assumed to be statistically stationary. On the basis of these assumptions a general expression is derived for the covariance function of the composite field in terms of the covariance of the indicator variable and the properties of the composite materials. Darcy's law and perturbation method are applied to develop the covariance of the retarded velocity. The numerical method of moments [Zhang et al., ; Wu et al., a, b] is used to study the effects of various uncertain parameters on flow and transport predictions. Case studies have been conducted to investigate the influences of a medium's physical and chemical heterogeneity and nonstationarity on solute flux prediction. The study results indicate that the large-scale heterogeneity dominates the effects on flow and solute transport processes, and the effect of small-scale heterogeneity is secondary. It is also shown from the case studies that the numerical method of moments is applicable to studying flow and solute transport in complex subsurface environments, especially for the uncertainty analysis. Monte Carlo simulation is also conducted, and the results are compared with those obtained through method of moment. The calculation results of the mean total solute flux by the two methods match very well, but the variance of total solute flux obtained by the method of moments is smaller than that by the Monte Carlo method, especially for the cases with large total variances of the conductivity and sorption coefficient.

In this paper, we propose a methodology for extracting the key information from routinely-available meteorological parameters and the emission pattern of sources present throughout the year (e.g. traffic emissions) to build a reliable and physically-based ANN air pollution forecasting tool. The methodology is tested by modeling NO concentrations at a site near a major highway in Auckland, New Zealand. The basic model consists of an ANN model for predicting NO concentrations using eight predictor variables: wind speed, wind direction, solar radiation, temperature, relative humidity, as well as ""hour of the day"", ""day of the week"" and ""month of the year"" representing the time variations in emissions according to their corresponding time scales. Of the three input optimization techniques explored in this study, namely a genetic algorithm, forward selection, and backward elimination, the genetic algorithm technique gave predictions resulting in the smallest mean absolute error. The nature of the internal nonlinear function of the trained genetically-optimized neural network model was then extracted based on the response of the model to perturbations to individual predictor variables through sensitivity analyses. A simplified model, based on the successive removal of the least significant meteorological predictor variables, was then developed until subsequent removal resulted in a significant decrease in model performance. The developed ANN model was found to outperform a linear regression model based on the same input parameters. The proposed approach illustrates how the ANN modeling technique can be used to identify the key meteorological variables required to adequately capture the temporal variability in air pollution concentrations for a specific scenario.",,"Elangasinghe, MA|Singhal, N|Dirks, KN|Salmond, JA",ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION RESEARCH,air pollution modeling artificial neural networks sensitivity analysis meteorology no2 concentrations,10.5094/APR.2014.079

They are a significant food/feed-safety issue across the globe and represent a substantial financial burden for the world economy. Moreover, with a changing climate and fungal biota, there is now much discussion about emerging mycotoxins that are measurable at significant levels in crops world-wide. Unfortunately, we still know very little about the bioavailability and toxic potentials of many of these less characterized mycotoxins, including the large family of enniatins. In this study, we present new occurrence data for enniatin A, A, B, B and beauvericin in four Danish crops: oat, wheat, and barley from the  harvest, and rye from  harvest. The occurrence of the four enniatins were B>B>A>A. Enniatin B was detected in % of tested samples regardless of crop type. In addition to occurrence data, we report a proof-of-concept study using a human-relevant high-content hepatotoxicity, or quadroprobe, assay to screen mycotoxins for their cytotoxic potential. The assay was sensitive for most cytotoxic compounds in the .- mu M range. Among eight tested mycotoxins (enniatin B, beauvericin, altenariol, deoxynivalenol, aflatoxin B, andrastin A, citrinin, and penicillic acid), enniatin B and beauvericin showed significant cytotoxicity at a concentration lower than that for aflatoxin B, which is the archetypal acute hepatotoxic and liver-carcinogenic mycotoxin. Hence, the quadroprobe hepatotoxicity assay may become a valuable assessment tool for toxicity assessment of mycotoxins in the future."," (c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Multimedia chemical partitioning of  chemicals, expressed in dimensionless compartmental mass ratios, was predicted by SimpleBox , a Level III Fugacity model, together with the propagation of reported uncertainty for key physicochemical and transport properties, and degradation rates. Chemicals, some registered in priority lists, were selected according to the availability of experimental property data to minimize the influence of predicted information in model development. Chemicals were emitted in air or water in a fixed geographical scenario representing the Netherlands and characterized by five compartments (air, water, sediments, soil and vegetation). Quantitative structure-fate relationship (QSFR) models to predict mass ratios in different compartments were developed with support vector regression algorithms. A set of molecular descriptors, including the molecular weight and  counts of molecular constituents were adopted to characterize the chemical space. Out of the  chemicals,  were used for training and testing the QSFR models, while  were excluded from model development and were used as an external validation set. Training and test chemicals were selected and the domain of applicability (DOA) of the QSFRs established by means of self-organizing maps according to structural similarity.

Temperature had a non-linear effect on all pollutants, while LAI was important to NO deposition with a nearly linear effect. PAR and wind speed had limited effects on dry deposition of all pollutants; dry deposition was affected by PAR and wind speed only up to their threshold values.

Although its high computational cost is not an issue in iteratively solved problems, its inaccuracies are critical in path-dependent problems when remeshing is required. In this case, the errors caused by parametric inversion and interpolation in variables transfer to the new mesh can be as large as the gradient components. This paper presents an efficient modified finite difference approach that allows remeshing either in path-independent or path-dependent problems, not being affected by the aforementioned errors. The strategy to cope with remeshing is extensive to the semi-analytical method which, for non-linear analyses, is shown to be a particular case of the proposed finite difference sensitivity approach. With this implementation, the finite difference, the semi-analytical and the analytical sensitivity methods all have comparable computational costs. The perturbation of unstructured meshes is performed with an inverse power Laplacian smoothing. The low cost and the accuracy of the sensitivity fields obtained after remeshing are shown in two examples, considering shape and constitutive design variables."," Copyright (C) 2004 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.","Munoz-Rojas, PA|Fonseca, JSO|Creus, GJ",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUMERICAL METHODS IN ENGINEERING,sensitivity analysis non-linear finite element analysis path-dependent problems remeshing laplacian smoothing,10.1002/nme.1102

DELSA uses derivative-based local methods to obtain the distribution of parameter sensitivity across the parameter space, which promotes consideration of sensitivity analysis results in the context of simulated dynamics. This work presents DELSA, discusses how it relates to existing methods, and uses two hydrologic test cases to compare its performance with the popular global, variance-based Sobol' method. The first test case is a simple nonlinear reservoir model with two parameters. The second test case involves five alternative bucket-style hydrologic models with up to  parameters applied to a medium-sized catchment ( km()) in the Belgian Ardennes. Results show that in both examples, Sobol' and DELSA identify similar important and unimportant parameters, with DELSA enabling more detailed insight at much lower computational cost. For example, in the real-world problem the time delay in runoff is the most important parameter in all models, but DELSA shows that for about % of parameter sets it is not important at all and alternative mechanisms and parameters dominate. Moreover, the time delay was identified as important in regions producing poor model fits, whereas other parameters were identified as more important in regions of the parameter space producing better model fits. The ability to understand how parameter importance varies through parameter space is critical to inform decisions about, for example, additional data collection and model development.

Traditional CCC chart is used when the items from a process are inspected one-at-a-time following the production order. In recent years, the CCC chart has been generalized to accommodate some industrial practices where items from a process are inspected sample by sample and not according to the production order. In order to increase the sensitivity of the generalized CCC (GCCC) chart to changes in fraction nonconforming, the variable sampling interval (VSI) scheme is used in this study. The output characteristic within each sample is assumed with correlation. The statistical properties of the GCCC chart with the VSI scheme are deduced using the Markov chain method. In evaluating the usefulness of the VSI feature, GCCC charts with VSI and fixed sampling interval (FSI) schemes are compared in terms of their statistical properties. The comparison results show that using the VSI scheme can improve the speed of GCCC chart in detecting changes in fraction nonconforming. Finally, according to the comparison results, a design procedure is applied to an industrial example to validate its practicability. (C) ", Elsevier Ltd.

The main source of zoonotic Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts in human drinking water is likely to be from farm animals via catchment pathways with water as the main transport vector. The vast majority of small agricultural catchments are ungauged therefore it is difficult to use a process model to predict and understand the mechanisms and activities that regulate the risk of surface water contamination from agricultural areas. For this study, two ungauged agricultural catchments in Ireland were used to model Cryptosporidium oocyst transport using SWAT on a daily basis with reference data from adjacent catchment gauging stations. The results indicated that SWAT could simulate stream flow with good agreement between prediction and observation on a monthly basis (R() from . to . and E (efficiency) from . to .), but Cryptosporidium oocyst concentration results were less reliable (R() from . to ., P < .; with poor E -. to -.). A sensitivity analysis using independent parameter perturbation indicated that temperature was the most important parameter regulating oocyst transport in the study catchments and that the timing of manure application relative to the occurrence of water runoff event was critical. The results also showed that grazing management had little influence on predicted oocyst transport while fields fertilized with manure were the key critical source areas for microbial contaminations in the study catchments. It was concluded that the approach presented could be used to assist with understanding the epidemiology of waterborne cryptosporidiosis outbreaks and to improve catchment management for the safety of the general public health.

An experiment established in  in a Rhodic Hapludox with soybean (summer) and a mix of black oat + Italian ryegrass (winter) succession was used. Treatments consisted of different grazing intensities during the winter season: intensive grazing (IG), moderate grazing (MG), and no-grazing (NG).

To quantify basic cations budgets and efficiencies, the inputs and outputs of calcium, magnesium, and potassium, as well as their initial and final exchangeable soil stocks were evaluated. Areas under grazed treatments, regardless of the intensity (IC or MG), presented lower soil acidification. Calcium and magnesium budgets were negative under NG and positive under MG.

The experimental variables were: zinc applied to soil at six doses: , , , ,, , and ,mg of Zn+ kg(-) in the form of ZnCl (zinc chloride), and species of plant: oat (Avena sativa L.) cv. Chwat and white mustard (Sinapis alba) cv. Rota. Soil without the addition of zinc served as the control. During the growing season, soil samples were subjected to microbiological analyses on experimental days  and  to determine the abundance of organotrophic bacteria, actinomyces and fungi, and the activity of dehydrogenases, catalase and urease, which provided a basis for determining the soil resistance index (RS). The physicochemical properties of soil were determined after harvest. The results of this study indicate that excessive concentrations of zinc have an adverse impact on microbial growth and the activity of soil enzymes. The resistance of organotrophic bacteria, actinomyces, fungi, dehydrogenases, catalase and urease decreased with an increase in the degree of soil contamination with zinc. Dehydrogenases were most sensitive and urease was least sensitive to soil contamination with zinc.

Input data, such as meteorological forecasts or source term estimations, as well as poorly known model parameters contribute for a large part to this uncertainty. A sensitivity analysis with the method of Morris was carried out in the case of the Fukushima disaster as a first step towards the uncertainty analysis of the Polyphemus/PolairD model. The main difficulties stemmed from the high dimension of the model's input and output. Simple perturbations whose magnitudes were devised from a thorough literature review were applied to  uncertain inputs. Several outputs related to atmospheric activity and ground deposition were aggregated, revealing different inputs rankings. Other inputs based on gamma dose rates measurements were used to question the possibility of calibrating the inputs uncertainties. Some inputs, such as the cloud layer thickness, were found to have little influence on most considered outputs and could therefore be safely discarded from further studies. On the contrary, wind perturbations and emission factors for iodine and caesium are predominant. The performance indicators derived from dose rates observations displayed strong sensitivities. This emphasises the share of the overall uncertainty due to input uncertainties and asserts the relevance of the simple perturbation scheme that was employed in this work. (C) ", Elsevier Ltd.

Quantitative models of range expansion have rarely been applied to large vertebrates, although such tools could be useful for restoration and management of many threatened but recovering populations. Using the southern sea otter (Enhydra lutris nereis) as a case study, we utilized integro-difference equations in combination with a stage-structured projection matrix that incorporated spatial variation in dispersal and demography to make forecasts of population recovery and range recolonization. In addition to these basic predictions, we emphasize how to make these modeling predictions useful in a management context through the inclusion of parameter uncertainty and sensitivity analysis. Our models resulted in hind-cast (-) predictions of net population growth and range expansion that closely matched observed patterns. We next made projections of future range expansion and population growth, incorporating uncertainty in all model parameters, and explored the sensitivity of model predictions to variation in spatially explicit survival and dispersal rates. The predicted rate of southward range expansion (median = . km/yr) was sensitive to both dispersal and survival rates; elasticity analysis indicated that changes in adult survival would have the greatest potential effect on the rate of range expansion, while perturbation analysis showed that variation in subadult dispersal contributed most to variance in model predictions. Variation in survival and dispersal of females at the south end of the range contributed most of the variance in predicted southward range expansion. Our approach provides guidance for the acquisition of further data and a means of forecasting the consequence of specific management actions.

However, the finite-element-based shape design sensitivity analysis and optimization have experienced some bottleneck problems such as design parameterization and design remodeling during optimization. In this paper, as a remedy for these problems, an isogeometric-based shape design sensitivity analysis and optimization methods are developed incorporating with T-spline basis. In the shape design sensitivity analysis and optimization procedure using a standard finite element approach, the design boundary should be parameterized for the smooth variation of the boundary using a separate geometric modeler, such as a CAD system. Otherwise, the optimal design usually tends to fall into an undesirable irregular shape. In an isogeometric approach, the NURBS basis function that is used in representing the geometric model in the CAD system is directly used in the response analysis, and the design boundary is expressed by the same NURBS function as used in the analysis. Moreover, the smoothness of the NURBS can allow the large perturbation of the design boundary without a severe mesh distortion. Thus, the isogeometric shape design sensitivity analysis is free from remeshing during the optimization process. In addition, the use of T-spline basis instead of NURBS can reduce the number of degrees of freedom, so that the optimal solution can be obtained more efficiently while yielding the same optimum design shape.",,"Ha, SH|Choi, KK|Cho, S",STRUCTURAL AND MULTIDISCIPLINARY OPTIMIZATION,shape design sensitivity analysis shape design optimization isogeometric analysis t-spline nurbs design parameterization local refinement,10.1007/s00158-010-0503-0

In this study, the identifiability of parameter subsets of the hindered-compression models is evaluated for various experimental layouts. Global sensitivity analysis is used to preliminarily select the influential parameters which can be reasonably estimated, while the identifiability analysis of parameter subsets is conducted based on the local sensitivity functions and collinearity measures. The batch settling curve observations are informative for calibrating hindered parameters, and to determine the compression parameters, the concentration profile observations may need to be collected. For different experimental layouts, at least three parameters are identifiable, and the number of identifiable parameters can potentially increase to five, if both batch settling curve and concentration observations are available. The parameter subset identifiability is sensitive to the choice of initial parameter values, and determining the initial values of hindered parameters and gel concentration by measuring the hindered settling velocities and the top concentration of the static sediment respectively allows efficient reduction of the sensitivity. Parameter subset estimates are sensitive to the values of fixed parameters, and reliable estimation of identifiable parameter subsets is possible to significantly decrease model prediction uncertainties.

A hybrid application of order reduction methods, introduced previously, has been shown to effectively reduce the computational cost required to find a reduced order model with quantifiable bounds on the reduction errors, which is achieved by hybridizing the application of local variational and global sampling methods for order reduction. The method requires the evaluation of first-order derivatives of pseudo-responses with respect to input parameters and the ability to perturb input parameters within their user-specified ranges of variations. The derivatives are employed to find a subspace that captures all possible response variations resulting from all possible parameter variations with quantifiable accuracy. This paper extends the applicability of this methodology to multi-component models. This is achieved by employing a hybrid methodology to enable the transfer of sensitivity information between the various components in an efficient manner precluding the need for a global sensitivity analysis procedure, which is often envisaged to be computationally intractable. Finally, we introduce a new measure of conditioning for the subspace employed for order reduction. Although, the developments are general, they are applied here to smoothly behaving functions only. Extension to non-smooth functions will be addressed in a future article.

Soil contamination with cadmium can cause disorders in the growth and development of plants, and therefore may have an adverse effect on the volume and quality of yields. The purpose of this study has been to evaluate the effect of soil contamination with incremental doses of cadmium together with the application of neutralizing substances on the yield of oat (Avena sativa L.) and on the content, uptake and distribution of cadmium in oat plants. The research was based on a pot experiment conducted on cv. Dragon oat, grown on soil with the grain-size composition of loamy sand. Cadmium was introduced to soil in the form of cadmium chloride, in doses equal , , ,  and  mg Cd kg(-). In order to alleviate the negative effect of soil contamination with cadmium, neutralizing substances were used, such as compost, lime and brown coal. The statistical analysis of the results demonstrated the presence of a negative correlation between the cadmium doses and the volume of oat yields. The lowest cadmium dose ( mg Cd kg(-) of soil) significantly decreased the yield of oat straw and roots; regarding the grain yield, it was significantly depressed by the two highest cadmium doses ( and  mg Cd kg(-) of soil). Of the three neutralizing substances applied, compost had a positive effect on the quantity of grain yield, compost and brown coal affected positively the yield of straw, while soil liming significantly decreased the yield of roots. Soil contamination with cadmium significantly affected the content of cadmium, raising it in the separated parts of oat plants, of which roots contained the distinctly highest amounts of the pollutant. The highest cadmium uptake (. mg Cd pot(-)) was detected in oat straw, which on average accumulated % of this xenobiotic.

The KLME approach combines the Karhunen-Loeve decomposition of the underlying random conductivity field and the perturbative and polynomial expansions of dependent variables including the hydraulic head, flow velocity, dispersion coefficient, and solute concentration.

Through a series of two-dimensional examples, the validity of the KLME approach is evaluated against the classical Monte Carlo simulations. Results indicate that under the flow and transport conditions examined in this work, the KLME approach provides an accurate representation of the mean concentration. For the concentration variance, the accuracy of the KLME approach is good when the conductivity variance is .. As the conductivity variance increases up to ., the mismatch on the concentration variance becomes large, although the mean concentration can still be accurately reproduced by the KLME approach.

Regularization technique is introduced to alleviate the ill-conditioning in solving the equations. The numerical studies of stochastic FE model updating of a truss bridge are presented to verify the improved perturbation method under three different types of uncertainties, namely natural randomness, measurement noise, and the combination of the two. The results obtained using the perturbation method are in good agreement with, although less accurate than, those obtained using the Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) method.

Radar rainfall data compared with rain gauge measurements provide higher spatial and temporal resolutions. However, radar data obtained form reflectivity patterns are subject to various errors such as errors in reflectivity-rainfall (Z-R) relationships, variation in vertical profile of reflectivity, and spatial and temporal sampling among others. Characterization of such uncertainties in radar data and their effects on hydrologic simulations is a challenging issue. The superposition of random error of different sources is one of the main factors in uncertainty of radar estimates. One way to express these uncertainties is to stochastically generate random error fields and impose them on radar measurements in order to obtain an ensemble of radar rainfall estimates. In the present study, radar uncertainty is included in the Z-R relationship whereby radar estimates are perturbed with two error components: purely random error and an error component that is proportional to the magnitude of rainfall rates.

Sensitivity analysis should be performed to assess the reliability of the results but often the number of inputs of the model is so huge, and running the model is so time-consuming, that not all methods of sensitivity analysis are practically available. Screening methods detect which inputs have a major influence on the outputs. We briefly review the available screening methods, and discuss one in particular, Morris' OAT Design. We applied the method under different assumptions to a module of the RIVM Chronic Diseases Model, where we projected the rates of never smokers, former smokers and current smokers in time up to the year . based on smoking rates, start, stop and quit rates from  and information on selective mortality in smokers from the literature. Different assumptions with regard to the interval of the inputs used for screeing led to different conclusions, especially with regard to the importance of quit and relapse rates versus initial prevalence rates. This should not to be read as a lack of validity of the method, but it shows that any sensitivity method cannot be automated in a form that runs without expert guidance on the ranges.

The distinguishing feature of the GVM distribution is its definition on a cylindrical manifold, the underlying state space in which systems of orbital element coordinates are more accurately defined. When specialized to GVM distributions, the prediction step of the general Bayesian nonlinear filter is shown to be tractable and viable, thereby providing a novel means to propagate space object orbital uncertainty under nonlinear perturbed two-body dynamics.

The Odyssee software, one such tool for Fortran  codes, has been tested on a sample model that solves a D non-linear diffusion-type equation. Odyssee offers both the forward and the reverse differentiation modes, that produce the tangent and the cotangent models, respectively. The two modes have been implemented on the sample application. A comparison is made with a manually-produced differentiated code for this model (MD), obtained by solving the adjoint equations associated with the model's discrete state equations. Following a presentation of the methods and tools and of their relative advantages and drawbacks, the performances of the codes produced by the manual and automatic methods are compared, in terms of accuracy and of computing efficiency (CPU and memory needs). The perturbation method (finite-difference approximation of derivatives) is also used as a reference. Based on the test of Taylor, the accuracy of the two AD modes proves to be excellent and as high as machine precision permits, a good indication of Odyssee's capability to produce error-free codes. In comparison, the manually-produced derivatives (MD) sometimes appear to be slightly biased, which is likely due to the fact that a theoretical model (state equations) and a practical model (computer program) do not exactly coincide, while the accuracy of the perturbation method is very uncertain. The MD code largely outperforms all other methods in computing efficiency, a subject of current research for the improvement of AD tools. Yet these tools can already be of considerable help for the computer implementation of many numerical methods, avoiding the tedious task of hand-coding the differentiation of complex algorithms.", (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.,"Elizondo, D|Cappelaere, B|Faure, C",COMPUTERS & GEOSCIENCES,code differentiation optimization adjoint state data assimilation sensitivity analysis odyssee,10.1016/S0098-3004(01)00048-6

The objective of the work is to improve the manufacturing yield by tuning the parameters that significantly affect the yield. Several techniques were studied including the sensitivity analysis framework, which is currently used at several disk drive plants. From our initial experiments, we found that the sensitivity analysis results were not sufficiently good and the interactions between parameters were not identified. We then designed a new technique based on factorial designs, the parameter-screening factorials algorithm. Our method can work with a large number of inputs within reasonable computing time, and can identify both the parameter and the interaction effects. The results can be obtained more quickly and are better in comparison with the currently used technique. Moreover, by applying the technique to the full list instead of the pre-selected list of the manufacturing parameters, we discovered that the parameters watch list previously identified by the experts should be adjusted to include some extra parameters. After the results were validated by the experts, we designed software that automates the critical parameter analysis process.

Over all discovered localities, % of archaeological features were positively cropmarked and only % were negatively cropmarked. Point features like settlement pits, semi-sunken buildings and graves were substantially more frequent than linear features such as ditches, palisade fortifications and dikes. Negative and positive cropmarks were the best developed in stands of cereals, especially in barley, followed by wheat, rye and oat from tittering up to full ripeness.

The objective functions to be minimized consist of two parts; the first part is related with the due date performance (i.e., the tardiness of the jobs), while the second part is related with the setting of machine speeds. Therefore, the decision variables include both the production schedule (sequences of jobs) and the production rate of each machine. The optimization process, however, is significantly complicated by the stochastic factors in the manufacturing system. To address the difficulty, a simulation-based three-stage optimization framework is presented in this paper for high-quality robust solutions to the integrated scheduling problem. The first stage (crude optimization) is featured by the ordinal optimization theory, the second stage (finer optimization) is implemented with a metaheuristic called differential evolution, and the third stage (fine-tuning) is characterized by a perturbation-based local search.

The algorithm fits within the framework of particle Markov chain Monte Carlo (PMCMC) methods and uses a so-called alive particle filter. The particle filter requires only model simulations and, in this regard, our approach has connections with approximate Bayesian computation (ABC). However, an advantage of using the PMCMC approach in this setting is that simulated data can be matched with data observed one-at-a-time, rather than attempting to match on the full dataset simultaneously or on a low-dimensional non-sufficient summary statistic, which is common practice in ABC. For low integer-valued time series data, we find that it is often computationally feasible to match simulated data with observed data exactly. The alive particle filter uses negative binomial sampling in order to maintain a fixed number of particles. The algorithm creates an unbiased estimate of the likelihood, resulting in exact posterior inferences when included in an MCMC algorithm. In cases where exact matching is computationally prohibitive, a tolerance is introduced as in ABC. This paper further develops the alive particle filter by introducing auxiliary variables so that partially observed and/or non-Markovian models can be accommodated. We demonstrate that Bayesian model choice problems involving such models can be handled with this approach.

Under steady state conditions the sensitivity of the water depth to the Strickler coefficient is shown to obey a first-order ordinary differential equation that becomes linear under uniform conditions. This allows a ""half-distance"" to be defined, which indicates the size of the region over which the Strickler coefficient can be calibrated from stage measurements. This region extends downstream of the stage measurement point under subcritical conditions and upstream under supercritical conditions. The validity of the approach is checked against typical backwater curve calculations.

These critical source areas (CSA) are characterized by the occurrence of fast-flow processes like surface runoff or macropore flow to tile drains. Moreover, topographic barriers often interrupt the overland flow into the adjacent brook and lead to internal sink areas. From there artificial drains can create a shortcut to the stream network. We tested the predictability of CSA with a modified version of the hydrological Soil Moisture Distribution & Routing model (SMDR). The study area was a small agricultural catchment in Switzerland, in which herbicide losses to surface waters had been experimentally investigated. The small-scale structures, relevant for surface connectivity, were derived using terrain analysis algorithms based on a high-resolution digital elevation map. The analysis showed that surface runoff from a large part (%) of the study area cannot reach the stream network. Based on prior parameter estimates, the simulated discharge agreed well with the measured values for spring  (Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient of .). Surface saturation was mainly predicted for Gleysol areas, whereby topography was the main driver, and not soil properties. The spatial distribution of CSA and predicted runoff processes agreed well with measured herbicide losses. The main losses were predicted for connected areas prone to surface runoff; additional drained sinks (reinfiltration areas on unconnected areas) were identified as potential risk areas. The predictions are subject to substantial uncertainties. A local sensitivity analysis revealed that the model is most sensitive to parameters describing the lower boundary of the soil (deep percolation and depth of the soil). The spatial extent and the efficiency of the drainage system are also crucial for the spatial variability of herbicide losses.", (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The results show there was no extensive release of p-coumaric acid in both the absence and presence of Trichoderma xylanase by Aspergillus feruloyl esterase.

The model consists of an unsaturated zone on the top, an unconfined aquifer in the middle, and a second aquifer (aquitard) at the bottom. The unsaturated flow is described by Richard's equation, and the flows in unconfined aquifer and second layer are governed by the groundwater flow equation. The well partially penetrates the unconfined aquifer with a constant head in the well due to CHT. The governing equations of the model are linearized by the perturbation method and Gardner's exponential model is adopted to describe the soil retention curves. The solution of the model for drawdown distribution is obtained by applying the methods of Laplace transform and Weber transform. Then the solution for the wellbore flowrate is derived from the drawdown solution with Darcy's law. The issue of the equivalence of normalized drawdown predicted by the present solution for constant-head pumping and Tartakovsky and Neuman's () solution for constant-rate pumping is discussed. On the basis of the wellbore flowrate solution, the results of the sensitivity analysis indicate that the wellbore flowrate is very sensitive to the changes in the radial hydraulic conductivity and the thickness of the saturated zone. Moreover, the results predicted from the present wellbore flowrate solution indicate that this new solution can reduce to Chang's et al. (a) solution for homogenous aquifers when the dimensionless unsaturated exponent approaches . The unsaturated zone can be considered as infinite extent in the vertical direction if the thickness ratio of the unsaturated zone to the unconfined aquifer is equal to or greater than one. As for the leakage effect, it can be ignored when the vertical hydraulic conductivity ratio (i.e., the vertical hydraulic conductivity of the lower layer over that of the unconfined aquifer) is smaller than .. The present solution is compared with the numerical solution from FEMWATER for validation and the results indicate good match between these two solutions. Finally, the present solution is applied to a set of field drawdown data obtained from a CHT for the estimation of hydrogeologic parameters. (C) ", Elsevier Ltd.

Two sources of uncertainty were taken into account and compared: () uncertainty concerning the parameters of the governing equation; () uncertainty concerning the forcing functions. The mean annual concentrations of Dissolved Inorganic Nitrogen (DIN) was regarded as the model output, as it represents the largest fraction of the Total Dissolved Nitrogen, TDN, for which the current Italian legislation sets a quality target in the lagoon of Venice. A local sensitivity analysis was initially used, so as to rank the parameters and provide an initial estimation of the uncertainty, which is a result of an imperfect knowledge of the dynamic of the system. This uncertainty was compared with that induced by an imperfect knowledge of the loads of Nitrogen, which represent the main forcing functions. On the basis of the results of the local analysis, the most important parameters and loads were then taken as the sources of uncertainty, in an attempt to assess their relative contributions. The global uncertainty and sensitivity analyses were carried out by means of a sampling-based Monte Carlo method. The results of the subsequent input-output regression analysis suggest that the variance in the model output could be partitioned among the sources of uncertainty, in accordance with a linear model. Based on this model, % of the variance in the mean annual concentration of DIN was accounted for by the uncertainty in the parameters which specify the dynamics of the phytoplankton and zooplankton, and only % by the uncertainties in the three main Nitrogen sources.

In this sense, the available multiple well test datasets are used to calibrate the geological model parameters rather than fitting simplified analytical models. In the exercise studied in this paper, the parameter space includes a range of geostatistical, petrophysical, and structural parameters. The differential evolution algorithm starts with an initial random population from the ranges of input variables and progresses with successive evaluation of the static models' transient tests. The static models' input parameters are perturbed to generate new populations, which can finally match the truth model well test derivative with lower misfits. The ensemble of population models (samples) along with the misfit values are used to highlight the value of well test data in reducing the uncertainty in the parameter space. A Bayesian framework is employed to implement the Markov chain Monte Carlo (McMC) methods to estimate the posterior distributions of the parameters. The results are confirmed by the sample-based Sobol sensitivity indices, which rank the influential parameters. To reduce the computational cost of the McMC and sensitivity indices, a cross-validated proxy model (i.e., Multivariate Adaptive Regression Spline) is constructed.

While it has been shown that prescribed fire can be a successful tool in controllingmedusahead populations, fire treatments are not always successful. Given the sociological and economic constraints of prescribed fire use, it is critically important that we maximize likelihood of treatment success. We conducted experimental investigation of population dynamics of competing species from different functional groups: invasive annual medusahead, naturalized but forageable nonnative wild oat (Avena spp. Pott ex Link), and native perennial purple needlegrass (Stipa pulchra [Hitchc.] Barkworth). We observed population dynamics at the -m() scale before and after treatments of prescribed fire and seed-limitation (weed whipping in a -m buffer area). We asked ) what is the role of seed dispersal from burn edges on subsequent medusahead population size? and ) how do density and fecundity of the dominant species respond to fire?

Deposition velocity and ozone flux depend on the weather situation, physiological state of the plants and numerous surface-, vegetation-, and soil-dependent parameters. The input data and the parameters of deposition-related calculations all have higher or lower spatial and temporal variability. We have investigated the effect of the variability of the meteorological data (cloudiness, relative humidity and air temperature), plant-dependent (leaf area index and maximum stomatal conductance) and soil-dependent (soil moisture) parameters on ozone deposition velocity. To evaluate this effect, two global methods, the Morris method and the Monte Carlo analysis with Latin hypercube sampling were applied. Additionally, local sensitivity analyses were performed to estimate the contribution of non-stomatal resistances to deposition velocity. Using the Monte Carlo simulations, the ensemble effect of several nonlinear processes can be recognised and described. Based on the results of the Morris method, the individual effects on deposition velocity are found to be significant in the case of soil moisture and maximum stomatal conductance. Temperature and leaf area index are also important factors: the former is primarily in the case of agricultural land, while the latter is for grass and coniferous forest. The results of local sensitivity analyses reveal the importance of non-stomatal resistances. (c) ", Elsevier Ltd.

In some cases, it may be that simulation results are used instead of experiments, since experiments are expensive and require a great deal of time. One such example is the determination of solubilities of different elements under different conditions, e.g. different temperatures and water compositions. It is important when working with computer simulations, however, to remember that the result is a direct function of the input data, i.e. if input data are slightly uncertain, so will be the results. The main input data to solubility calculations are thermodynamic data, such as stability constants and enthalpies of reactions, and water composition data. The thermodynamic data have been discussed elsewhere, and the focus of this paper is thus on the water parameters. The uncertainties in water composition may originate from at least two different sources. Either the water composition at a certain location has been measured, thus making the main measurements uncertain, or the uncertainties in water composition arise from computed estimates of water composition on the basis of rock-water interactions. To investigate these different approaches, two programs, MINVAR and UNCCON, have been developed. The MINVAR program gives uncertainties in water composition caused by uncertainties in rock composition using the CRACKER code. These uncertainties or measurement uncertainties may then be transferred to the UNCCON program, which estimates the effect on the calculated solubilities. Both programs use the Latin Hypercube sampling technique.", (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Among the new desulfurization technologies, the olefin alkylation of thiophenic sulfur (OATS) process is more attractive than hydrodesulfurization because of its mild operating conditions and low loss of octane number. In this work, a sensitivity analysis and an economic analysis of a catalytic distillation process for alkylation desulfurization of fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) gasoline are presented. The objective is to evaluate the effects of various design and operating parameters on the OATS process by using a realistic FCC gasoline fraction. RESULTSA sensitivity analysis performed for operating pressure, reflux ratio, bottom flow rate, feed conditions, number of separate stages, number of reactive stages, catalyst weight, feed location, reactive zone position, and an economic analysis based on total annual costs (TAC) for these variables were studied.

An application of the Monte Carlo simulation-based derived distribution approach is presented in this two-parr paper to explore the influence of climate, described by simulated rainfall and evapotranspiration time series, and basin factors on the flood frequency curve (ffc). The sensitivity analysis conducted in the paper should not be interpreted as reflecting possible climate changes, but the results can provide an indication of the changes to which the flood frequency curve might be sensitive. A single site Neyman Scott point process model of rainfall, with convective and stratiform cells (Cowpertwait, ; ), has been employed to generate synthetic rainfall inputs to a rainfall runoff model. The time series of the potential evapotranspiration (ETp) demand has been represented through an AR(n) model with seasonal component, while a simplified version of the ARNO rainfall-runoff model (Todini, ) has been employed to simulate the continuous discharge time series. All these models have been parameterised in a realistic manner using observed data and results from previous applications, to obtain 'reference' parameter sets for a synthetic case study. Subsequently, perturbations to the model parameters have been made one-nt-a-time and the sensitivities of the generated annual maximum rainfall and flood frequency curves (unstandardised, and standardised by the mean) have been assessed. Overall, the sensitivity analysis described in this paper suggests that the soil moisture regime, and, in particular, the probability distribution of soil moisture content at the storm arrival time, can be considered as a unifying link between the perturbations to the several parameters and their effects on the standardised and unstandardised ffcs, thus revealing the physical mechanism through which their influence is exercised. However, perturbations to the parameters of the linear routing component affect only the unstandardised ffc. In Franchini rt rrl. (), the sensitivity analysis of the model parameters has been assessed through an analysis of variance (ANOVA) of the results obtained from a formal experimental design, where all the parameters are allowed to vary simultaneously, thus providing deeper insight into the interactions between the different factors. This approach allows a wider range of climatic and basin conditions to be analysed and reinforces the results presented in this paper, which provide valuable new insight into the climatic and basin factors controlling the ffc.",,"Hashemi, AM|Franchini, M|O'Connell, PE",HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES,stochastic rainfall model rainfall runoff model simulation derived distribution flood frequency sensitivity analysis,10.5194/hess-4-463-2000

CHLORIDE STRESS GROWTH SODIUM WHEAT FIBER GRAIN,"Improvement of saline-alkali soils by biological means is a strategic soil conservation method. To investigate the capacity of oat for phytoremediation, two factor randomized block design experiments are carried out in coastal North China. The two factors - oat variety (""Ba You-"" - BU, ""Hua Zao-"" - HZ and ""Bai Yan-"" - BY) and soil salinity (., . and . g kg(-)) - are analyzed for oat biomass, straw ion accumulation and straw-to-soil ion concentration ratio. Results show that oat biomass be affected by harvest time and soil salinity. BU biomass decreases by . t ha(-) for harvest delay by  days. And BY biomass drops severely which from . t ha(-) in low soil salinity to . t ha(-) in high soil salinity. The straw ion concentration (except Ca+) significantly drops when harvest is delayed, but it increases with soil salinity increases though K+ concentration markedly decreases. For the straw ion accumulation, the highest value for harvest time is at maturity (. kg ha(-) for BU) and for soil salinity is at low level (. kg ha(-) for BY) and it turns sharp decrease with the time delaying and soil salinity increasing.

The correlation analysis reveals that oat ion accumulation is positively correlated with biomass. Besides, straw Na+ and Cl- accumulation is respectively negatively (p < .) correlated with K+.

Calculating the surface ocean partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO(sw)) from float pH has uncertainty contributions from the pH sensor, the alkalinity estimate, and carbonate system equilibrium constants, resulting in a relative standard uncertainty in pCO(sw) of .% (or  mu atm at pCO(sw) of  mu atm). The calculated pCO(sw) from several floats spanning a range of oceanographic regimes are compared to existing climatologies. In some locations, such as the subantarctic zone, the float data closely match the climatologies, but in the polar Antarctic zone significantly higher pCO(sw) are calculated in the wintertime implying a greater air-sea CO efflux estimate. Our results based on four representative floats suggest that despite their uncertainty relative to direct measurements, the float data can be used to improve estimates for air-sea carbon flux, as well as to increase knowledge of spatial, seasonal, and interannual variability in this flux. Plain Language Summary The Southern Ocean is a key player in the global flow of carbon, yet it is hard to reach, and there are relatively few measurements there, especially in winter. Measuring the amount of carbon dioxide gas in seawater is key to advancing our understanding of the Southern Ocean. More than  robotic floats that use sensors to measure seawater properties have been deployed throughout the Southern Ocean, and each has a lifetime of around  years. It is currently not possible to directly measure carbon dioxide gas from these floats; however, it is possible to estimate carbon dioxide from things that the float can measure, like pH, a measure of ocean acidity. Here surface ocean carbon dioxide is estimated from several floats and compared to two ship-based estimates. In some locations, the floats closely match the existing estimates, but in other locations the floats see significantly higher surface ocean carbon dioxide in the wintertime, reinforcing the idea that the Southern Ocean's role in the global carbon cycle needs a closer look. Our results show that despite not measuring carbon dioxide directly, these floats will help scientists learn a lot about the Southern Ocean's part in the global flow of carbon.",,"Williams, NL|Juranek, LW|Feely, RA|Johnson, KS|Sarmiento, JL|Talley, LD|Dickson, AG|Gray, AR|Wanninkhof, R|Russell, JL|Riser, SC|Takeshita, Y",GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES,,10.1002/2016GB005541

Simulations were performed for three soil types (clay, silt, and sand), two source depths ( and  m), and two source concentrations ( and  g/m()). Model sensitivity and uncertainty for shallow and high-concentration vapor sources ( m and  g/m()) are much smaller than for deep and low-concentration sources ( m and  g/m()). For high-concentration sources, soil air permeability, indoor air exchange rate, and building depressurization (for high permeable soil like sand) are key contributors to model output uncertainty. For low-concentration sources, soil porosity, soil moisture, aerobic biodegradation rate and soil gas permeability are key contributors to model output uncertainty.

In historical floods reconstruction, due to the lower precision of input data, the magnitude of this uncertainty could reach a high value. With the objectives of giving an estimate of the peak flow error of a typical historical flood reconstruction with the model HEC-RAS and of providing a quick, simple uncertainty assessment that an end user could easily apply, the uncertainty of the reconstructed peak flow of a major flood in the Ebro River (NE Iberian Peninsula) was calculated with a set of local sensitivity analyses on six input variables. The peak flow total error was estimated at +/- % and water height was found to be the most influential variable on peak flow, followed by Manning's n. However, the latter, due to its large uncertainty, was the greatest contributor to peak flow total error. Besides, the HEC-RAS resulting peak flow was compared to the ones obtained with the D model Iber and with Manning's equation; all three methods gave similar peak flows. Manning's equation gave almost the same result than HEC-RAS. The main conclusion is that, to ensure the lowest peak flow error, the reliability and precision of the flood mark should be thoroughly assessed.", (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This paper compares two regression-based RFFA methods using a Bayesian generalized least squares (GLS) modelling framework; the two are quantile regression technique (QRT) and parameter regression technique (PRT). In this study, the QRT focuses on the development of prediction equations for a flood quantile in the range of  to  years average recurrence intervals (ARI), while the PRT develops prediction equations for the first three moments of the log Pearson Type  (LP) distribution, which are the mean, standard deviation and skew of the logarithms of the annual maximum flows; these regional parameters are then used to fit the LP distribution to estimate the desired flood quantiles at a given site. It has been shown that using a method similar to stepwise regression and by employing a number of statistics such as the model error variance, average variance of prediction, Bayesian information criterion and Akaike information criterion, the best set of explanatory variables in the GLS regression can be identified. In this study, a range of statistics and diagnostic plots have been adopted to evaluate the regression models. The method has been applied to  catchments in Tasmania, Australia. It has been found that catchment area and design rainfall intensity are the most important explanatory variables in predicting flood quantiles using the QRT. For the PRT, a total of four explanatory variables were adopted for predicting the mean, standard deviation and skew. The developed regression models satisfy the underlying model assumptions quite well; of importance, no outlier sites are detected in the plots of the regression diagnostics of the adopted regression equations. Based on one-at-a-time cross validation and a number of evaluation statistics, it has been found that for Tasmania the QRT provides more accurate flood quantile estimates for the higher ARIs while the PRT provides relatively better estimates for the smaller ARIs. The RFFA techniques presented here can easily be adapted to other Australian states and countries to derive more accurate regional flood predictions."," Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Haddad, K|Rahman, A|Stedinger, JR",HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,regional flood frequency bayesian method quantile regression parameter regression design floods,10.1002/hyp.8189

An input is considered influential if the input pdf modification leads to a broad change in the failure probability. These sensitivity indices can be computed using the sole set of simulations that has already been used to estimate the failure probability, thus limiting the number of calls to the numerical model.

A new chronic plant test system which is based on experiences with various acute plant tests (e.g. published by OECD or ISO) and existing North American Plant-Life-Cycle Bioassays was standardised in a project sponsored by the German government. Characteristic properties of the test system, which can be performed either with Brassica rapa (turnip rape) or Avena sativa (oat), are described in Part  of this mini-series. Methods. This new test was used to assess the effects of natural soil samples contaminated with TNT (,,-Trinitrotoluene) or PAHs (poly-aromatic hydrocarbons). The soils were tested after taken from the field as well as after being remediated. Different control and reference soils were used to evaluate the test results. In addition, they were compared with the results of tests in which either TNT or Pyrene were spiked to field and standard soils (see Part  of this mini-series). Results. All contaminated soils showed clear effects in the Chronic Plant Test (usually B. rapa was more sensitive than A. sativa). LUFA . standard soil and OECD artificial soil are well-suited as control and mixture substrates, while reference soils collected at uncontaminated sites were several times as phytotoxic. In most of the latter cases, soil properties could be identified as the main cause of these effects (e.g. the pH value). While the sensitivity of the reproduction and biomass endpoints did not differ much in general, it is recommended to measure different endpoints (i.e. biomass and reproduction) due to the different mode-of-action of contaminants. In the case of TNT, a good agreement between the results of single chemical tests and tests with TNT-contaminated soils was found (due to the minimal effects of Pyrene, the same statement is not possible for PAHs). Outlook. The results of this work have been used to prepare a draft test guideline, which has recently been standardised by the International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO).

Independent variables with known probability distributions,SENSITIVITY-ANALYSIS DEPENDENT-VARIABLES,"High dimensional model representation (HDMR) is a general set of quantitative model assessment and analysis tools for capturing high dimensional input-output system behavior. In practice, the HDMR component functions are each approximated by an appropriate basis function expansion. This procedure often requires many input-output samples which can restrict the treatment of high dimensional systems. In order to address this problem we introduce svr-based HDMR to efficiently and effectively construct the HDMR expansion by support vector regression (SVR) for a function . In this paper the results for independent variables sampled over known probability distributions are reported. The theoretical foundation of the new approach relies on the kernel used in SVR itself being an HDMR expansion (referred to as the HDMR kernel ), i.e., an ANOVA kernel whose component kernels are mutually orthogonal and all non-constant component kernels have zero expectation. Several HDMR kernels are constructed as illustrations. While preserving the characteristic properties of HDMR, the svr-based HDMR method enables efficient construction of high dimensional models with satisfactory prediction accuracy from a modest number of samples, which also permits accurate computation of the sensitivity indices. A genetic algorithm is employed to optimally determine all the parameters of the component HDMR kernels and in SVR. The svr-based HDMR introduces a new route to advance HDMR algorithms.

Exposure scenarios were constructed and simulated with the MERLIN-Expo tool to estimate external Pb exposure as well as the Pb body burden in children living in the vicinity of the former industrial sites as compared to children living in adjacent areas and a reference area. Simulations were run for several scenarios ranging from very simple to rather complex in order to study the effect of different simulation approaches (e.g., deterministic vs. probabilistic, individual vs. aggregated population exposure) and different exposure scenarios (e.g., with vs. without considering local food consumption or time activity patterns) on the model outcomes (predicted concentrations of Pb in environmental and human matrices). This paper discusses the two most complex scenarios, namely exposure at the aggregated population level and at the individual level for a random sub-sample of subjects, respectively. In the final and most realistic exposure scenario, simulating individual lead exposure, model predictions were shown to be higher than the biomonitoring data. Blood Pb levels in children, irrespective of the area they lived in, were overpredicted by MERLIN-Expowith a factor of about  on average. The model predictions for individual children overlap with the prediction interval calculated by MERLIN-Expo based on population averages, demonstrating the use of probabilistic approaches in risk assessment.

Perturbation to the interactions occur due to randomized and fixated changes (in molecular evolution) or designed modifications of the protein structures (in bioengineering). These perturbations are modifications in the topology and the strength of the interactions modeled by the elastic network models. We discuss how a naive approach to compute properties for a large number of perturbed structures and interactions by repeated diagonalization can be replaced with an identity found in linear algebra. We argue about the computational complexity and discuss the advantages of the protocol.

The effect of ambient ozone on PSII activity was examined by measurements of chlorophyll (Chl) a fluorescence. In leaves with visible symptoms, the function of PSII was changed at high actinic irradiances. Nonphotochemical quenching (NPQ) was higher and quantum efficiency of PSII (Phi (PSH)). photochemical quenching (q(p)) quantum efficiency of excitation capture and PSII electron flow (F-v'/F'(m)) were lower. An enhanced susceptibility to photoinhibition was observed for symptom-exhibiting leaves compared to leaves that remain free of visible symptoms. Both the lowering of photosynthesis efficiency and the increased sensitivity to photoinhibition probably contribute to reduced crop yield in the field, to different extents, depending on growth conditions.

The analysis specifically recognizes the significance of the difference between the magnitude of uncertainty associated with absolute hydrologic and water quality predictions, and uncertainty in estimated benefits of BMPs. The Soil and Water Assessment Toot (SWAT) is integrated with Monte Carlo-based simulations, aiming at () adjusting the suggested range of model. parameters to more realistic site-specific ranges based on observed data, and () computing a scaled distribution function to assess the effectiveness of BMPs. A three-step procedure based on the One-factor-At-a-Time (OAT) sensitivity analysis and the Generalized Liketihood Uncertainty Estimation (GLUE) was implemented for the two study watersheds. Results indicate that the suggested range of some SWAT parameters, especially the ones that are used to determine the transport capacity of channel network and initial concentration of nutrients in soils, required site-specific adjustment. It was evident that uncertainties associated with sediment and nutrient outputs of the model were too large, perhaps limiting its application for point estimates of design quantities. However, the estimated effectiveness of BMPs sampled at different points in the parameter space varied by less than % for all variables of interest. This suggested that BMP effectiveness could be ascertained with good confidence using models, thus making it suitable for use in watershed management plans such as the EPA's Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) program.

The model structure is designed to be transparent and flexible, and therefore it can be applied in different geographical contexts and adapted to the actual knowledge of hazard and vulnerability variables. The model has been tested in a recent flood event in northern Italy.

It consists of an urban drainage model, a river water quality model and a tool for the quantification of adverse dissolved oxygen (DO) conditions in the river, one of the main stressors for urban lowland rivers. The coupled model was calibrated successfully with average Nash-Sutcliffe-efficiencies for DO in the river of . and . for two validation years. Moreover, the whole range of observed DO concentrations after CSO down to  mg L- is simulated by the model. A local sensitivity analysis revealed that in the absence of CSO dissolved oxygen principally depends on phytoplankton dynamics. Regarding CSO impacts, it was shown that % of the observed DO deficit can be explained by the three processes (i) mixing of river water with CSO spill water poor in DO, (ii) reduced phytoplankton activity due to CSO-induced turbidity and (iii) degradation of organic matter by heterotrophic bacteria. As expected, process (iii) turned out to be the most important one. However depending on the time lag after CSO the other processes can become dominant. Given the different involved processes, we found that different mitigation schemes tested in a scenario analysis can reduce the occurrence of critical DO deficits in the river by -%. Overall, the study demonstrates that integrated sewer-river-models can be set up to represent CSO impacts under complex urban conditions. However, a significant effort in monitoring and modelling is a requisite for achieving reliable results. (C) ", Elsevier Ltd.

Forward modeling sensitivities have predominantly been calculated using the finite difference approach, i.e. where the results of two separate simulations are subtracted. The finite difference approach incurs truncation and cancellation errors, which mean that exact sensitivities cannot be calculated and even approximate sensitivities cannot always be calculated for a sufficiently small perturbation (e.g. for emissions at a single location or time). Other sensitivity methods can provide exact sensitivities, but require the reformulation of non-linear steps (e.g. the decoupled direct method) or the development of adjoints of entire codes (partly automatically and partly manually). While the adjoint approach is widely applied and has significant utility in providing receptor-oriented information, in some applications the source-oriented information of forward approaches is needed. Here we apply an alternative method of calculating sensitivities that results in source-oriented information as with the finite difference approach, requires minimal reformulation of models, but enables near-exact computation of sensitivities. This approach - the complex step method - is applied for the first time to a complete atmospheric chemistry-transport model (GEOS-Chem). (The complex step method has been previously used in validating the adjoint of an aerosol thermodynamic equilibrium model.) We also introduce the idea of combining complex-step and adjoint sensitivity analysis (for the first time in any context to our knowledge) to enable the direct calculation of near-exact second order sensitivities.

Starting from the classical waterhammer equations in a single-phase liquid with friction (the direct problem) the state vector comprising the piezometric head and the velocity was defined. Applying the differential method the adjoint operator, the adjoint equations with the general form of their boundary conditions, and the general form of the bilinear concomitant were calculated for a single pipe. Considering that any hydraulic network can be built by connecting different components (reservoirs, valves, pumps, tees, etc.) through pipes, the adjoint relationships for any component, as well as the final contribution to the bilinear concomitant, were calculated. Moreover, an analogy was established in which transmission and reflection coefficients can be derived for any adjoint component. The importance or adjoint function was analyzed when the piezometric. head or velocity at a given position and time is chosen as the response functional. In this case, it is shown that the importance function is represented by delta-functions travelling along the hydraulic network with the propagation speed. The calculation of the sensitivity coefficients takes into account the cases in which the parameters under consideration influence the initial condition. For these cases, the calculation can be performed by solving sequentially two perturbative problems: the first one is non-steady, while the second one is steady, with an appropriate selection of a weight function coming from the unsteady perturbative problem. The discretized adjoint equations and the corresponding boundary conditions were programmed and solved by using the method of characteristics. As an example, a constant-level tank connected through a pipe to a valve discharging to atmosphere was considered. The corresponding sensitivity coefficients due to the variation of different parameters by using both the differential method and the response surface generated by the computer code WHAT, solver of the direct problem, were also calculated.

Wheat grain from organic farming was characterized by a higher content of Mn and by significantly higher content of Fe, Zn, Ca and Mg when compared to grain originating from conventional farming. The increased availability of potassium in soil, caused by the applied potassium salt fertilization, was reflected in a higher content of this macronutrient in grain of all cereals from conventional cultivation.

Juno) treated for h with two selected concentrations of Pb(NO)():  mg l(-), which inhibited root growth by about % (medium stress intensity), as well as  mg l(-), which almost entirely suppressed root elongation (severe stress intensity). Relative water content (RWC), which characterizes the degree of root water saturation, slightly increased at the lower lead concentration and remained unchanged at the higher lead dose. Ultrastructure analyses under a transmission electron microscope revealed that plasmolysis was not evoked by lead in the apical part of the meristem. Moreover, direct observation of meristem cells using Nomarsky optics indicated enhanced vacuolization in the presence of both lead concentrations. These data suggest that the water status of the roots was not affected by the metal. Due to the fact that proline is involved in the maintenance of turgor in the cells, the metabolism of this amino acid was investigated. In the roots, the activity of enzymes involved in proline synthesis, such as pyrroline--carboxylate synthetase (PCS) and ornithine aminotransferase (OAT), increased at  mg l(-) Pb+; nevertheless, proline content was diminished at the lower lead concentration. This effect is likely the result of proline degradation by proline dehydrogenase (PDH), since the activity of this enzyme increased at the lower lead dose. On the other hand, in the presence of  mg l(-) Pb+, a low level of proline was correlated with a decrease in the activity of PCS and OAT, as well as unchanged PDH activity in lupine roots. These data may imply that enzymatic synthesis of proline was strongly damaged by the metal ions. The low level of proline in both experimental variants suggests that proline accumulation is inessential to maintaining the osmotic uptake of water into root cells. NMR spectroscopy showed that exposition of lupine seedlings to lead caused a deceleration in water transport in the roots due to a reduction in the water transfer rate across the membranes (transmembrane transfer) and vacuoles continuum, as well as water diffusion along the root apoplast. Fluorescence staining and immunogold labeling showed the presence of callose strands in cell walls and/or in the vicinity of them. In lead-treated lupine roots, callose was mainly localized in the parenchyma cortex placed lengthwise to the vascular cylinder. Callose deposits in the cell walls may reduce vacuolar transport, as well as increase cell wall resistance to water flow. Deceleration of diffusional water movement to the vascular system, may in turn, influence the rate of long-distance water transport to aerial parts of the plant.", (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

This study investigates the sensitivity of and uncertainty in crop water footprint (in m() t-()) estimates related to uncertainties in important input variables. The study focuses on the green (from rainfall) and blue (from irrigation) water footprint of producing maize, soybean, rice, and wheat at the scale of the Yellow River basin in the period -. A grid-based daily water balance model at a  by  arcmin resolution was applied to compute green and blue water footprints of the four crops in the Yellow River basin in the period considered. The one-at-a-time method was carried out to analyse the sensitivity of the crop water footprint to fractional changes of seven individual input variables and parameters: precipitation (PR), reference evapotranspiration (ET), crop coefficient (K-c), crop calendar (planting date with constant growing degree days), soil water content at field capacity (S-max), yield response factor (K-y) and maximum yield (Y-m). Uncertainties in crop water footprint estimates related to uncertainties in four key input variables: PR, ET, K-c, and crop calendar were quantified through Monte Carlo simulations. The results show that the sensitivities and uncertainties differ across crop types. In general, the water footprint of crops is most sensitive to ET and K-c, followed by the crop calendar. Blue water footprints were more sensitive to input variability than green water footprints. The smaller the annual blue water footprint is, the higher its sensitivity to changes in PR, ET, and K-c. The uncertainties in the total water footprint of a crop due to combined uncertainties in climatic inputs (PR and ET) were about +/- % (at % confidence interval). The effect of uncertainties in ET was dominant compared to that of PR.

However, sewage sludge has improved in quality during the last half century and source separation of organic household waste has been shown to decrease the concentration of heavy metals in composts made from organic waste. This alongside a growing awareness on the benefits of an increased degree a recycling of nutrients from urban areas to agricultural soils led to the establishment of the CRUCIAL field trial in  where different urban and animal wastes have been applied each year. In the present study we investigated the effect of the different animal and urban waste treatments in CRUCIAL on oat yield after ten years of experimentation on concentrations of heavy metals in oat grain harvested in the field and pea plants grown in a pot trial using soil from the CRUCIAL field trial. We found that all animal and urban waste fertilizers were suitable for fertilization purposes, although some of these will result in unbalanced nutrient inputs if used as single sources. Furthermore, we found that of the elements studied only Zn and Cu were significantly elevated in soil concentration in the urban waste treatments. In oat grain Cd was significantly elevated in a sewage sludge treatment corresponding to more than  years' legal application, but even in this extreme case the concentration of Cd in grain did not exceed the relevant EU limit for Cd content. In pea plants only the concentrations of Zn and Mo were significantly higher in plants grown in soil that had received large amounts of urban wastes compared to an unfertilized control and the build-up of Zn could be regarded as a beneficial side-effect of using sewage sludge as a fertilizer due to the status of Zn as an essential element.

Results show that the proposed STM can greatly improve the accuracy of the predicted relative state: the average error is found to be at least one order of magnitude smaller compared to the curvilinear C-W solution.

These parameters are subject to uncertainty due to measurement error and due to the spatial variability of properties in the subsurface environment. This paper compares the relative effects of uncertainty in the transport and reaction parameters on the results of a solute transport model. This question is addressed by comparing the magnitudes of the local sensitivity coefficients for transport and reaction parameters. General sensitivity equations are presented for transport parameters, reaction parameters, and the initial (background) concentrations in the problem domain. Parameter sensitivity coefficients are then calculated for an example problem in which uranium(VI) hydrolysis species are transported through a two-dimensional domain with a spatially variable pattern of surface complexation sites. In this example, the reaction model includes equilibrium speciation reactions and mass transfer-limited non-electrostatic surface complexation reactions. The set of parameters to which the model is most sensitive includes the initial concentration of one of the surface sites, the formation constant (Kr) of one of the surface complexes and the hydraulic conductivity within the reactive zone.

We perform the sensitivity analysis to noise of the biomedical robot concept using synthetic microarrays perturbed by different kinds of noises in expression and class assignment. Finally, we show the application of this concept to the analysis of different diseases, inferring the pathways and the correlation networks. The final aim of a biomedical robot is to improve knowledge discovery and provide decision systems to optimize diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis. This analysis shows that the biomedical robots are robust against different kinds of noises and particularly to a wrong class assignment of the samples. Assessing the uncertainty that is inherent to any phenotype prediction problem is the right way to address this kind of problem.",,"Deandres-Galiana, EJ|Fernandez-Martinez, JL|Sonis, ST",JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY,biomedical robots phenotype prediction translational genomics uncertainty assessment,10.1089/cmb.2016.0008

This modification leads to a generalized log-gamma regression model with a cure rate, encompassing, as special cases, the log-exponential, log-Weibull and log-normal regression models with a cure rate typically used to model such data. The models attempt to simultaneously estimate the effects of explanatory variables on the timing acceleration/deceleration of a given event and the surviving fraction, that is, the proportion of the population for which the event never occurs. The normal curvatures of local influence are derived under some usual perturbation schemes and two martingale-type residuals are proposed to assess departures from the generalized log-gamma error assumption as well as to detect outlying observations.

Our aim was to identify indicators of the environmental potential of botanical quality measured independently of the species composition of the vegetation. Data were collected on numerous sward, soil, and grassland management variables at  Danish low-lying grasslands managed under different intensities. Top soil from each site was bioassayed with oat (Avena saliva L.) as a phytometer. Correlation analyses were used to examine relationships among variables and groups of variables. Indicators independent of species composition of the vegetation related to high or low botanical nature quality were identified. Indicators for high potential nature quality were the K/P ratio in the sward and K concentration in bioassay plants. Indicators for low potential nature quality were dry matter (DM) production, feed units and P-concentration of the sward; dry weight, shoot number and leaf length in bioassay; potential N mineralisation rate and amount of mineral N in the soil in spring. We concluded that a combination of indicators was preferable to only one indicator, as botanical nature quality is influenced in a multi-factorial way.", (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

According to California state and regional air quality agencies, dairies are one of the major sources of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the SJV. A number of recently conducted studies reported emissions data from different dairy sources. However, limited data are currently available for silage and other feed storages on dairies, which could potentially contribute to ozone formation. Because the impact of different VOCs on ozone formation varies significantly from one molecular species to another, detailed characterization of VOC emissions is essential to include all the important contributors to atmospheric chemistry and especially atmospheric reactivity. The present research study identifies and quantifies the VOCs emitted from various silages and other feedstuffs. Experiments were conducted in an environmental chamber under controlled conditions. Almost  VOCs were identified and quantified from corn (Zea mays L.), alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.), and cereal (wheat [Triticum aestivum L.] and oat [Avena sativa L.] grains) silages, total mixed ration (TMR), almond (Amygdalus communis L.) shells and hulls using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and high performance liquid chromatography. The results revealed high concentrations of emitted alcohols and other oxygenated species. Lower concentrations of highly reactive alkenes and aldehydes were also detected.

This makes our approach easy to implement as stand-alone software, which aids microwave design based on commercial computer-aided design packages. We show that our sensitivity analysis approach yields Jacobians of second-order accuracy for lossy dielectric structures.

Plants were treated with ferrocyanide in a nutrient solution that simulated iron cyanide contaminated groundwater and soil solutions. This nutrient solution has been shown to maintain ferrocyanide speciation with minimal dissociation to free cyanide. Following treatment, all three plants showed dramatic enrichments in roots (delta ()Nparts per thousand = -) and shoots (()Nparts per thousand = ). Barley and oat showed enrichment primarily in roots while wild cane showed a near equal enrichment in root and shoot tissues. Nitrogen-deficient barley plants treated with ferrocyanide showed a significantly greater N- enrichment as compared to nitrogen-sufficient plants.

This paper proposes a methodological framework for analyzing prediction uncertainty of ecosystem models caused by parameters and applies it in Qianyanzhou subtropical coniferous plantation using the Simplified Photosynthesis and Evapotranspiration model. We selected  key parameters from  parameters of the model using one-at-a-time sensitivity analysis method and estimated their posterior distributions using Markov Chain Monte Carlo technique. Prediction uncertainty was quantified through Monte Carlo method and partitioned using Sobol' method by decomposing the total variance of model predictions into different components. The uncertainty in predicted net ecosystem CO exchange (NEE), gross primary production (GPP), ecosystem respiration (RE), evapotranspiration (ET), and transpiration (T), defined as the coefficient of variation, was .%, .%, .%, .%, and .%, respectively. Modeled carbon and water fluxes were highly sensitive to two parameters, maximum net CO assimilation rate (A(max)) and specific leaf weight (SLWC). They contributed more than two thirds of the uncertainty in predicted NEE, GPP, ET, and T and almost one third of the uncertainty in predicted RE, which should be focused on in further efforts to reduce uncertainty.

214,WOS:000331662800035,2014,Three-dimensional aquifer inversion under unknown boundary conditions,HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY GROUNDWATER PERMEABILITY MODEL,"A new method for three-dimensional steady-state aquifer inversion is developed to simultaneously estimate aquifer hydraulic conductivities and the unknown aquifer boundary conditions (BC). The method has its key strength in computational efficiency, as there is no need to fit an objective function, nor repeated simulations of a forward flow model. It employs a discretization scheme based on functional approximations and a collocation technique to enforce the global flow solution. The noisy observed data are directly incorporated into the inversion matrix, which is solved in a one-step procedure. The inverse solution includes hydraulic conductivities and head and flux approximating functions from which the model BC can be inferred. Thus a key advantage of the method is that it eliminates the non-uniqueness associated with parameter estimation under unknown BC which can cause the result of inversion sensitive to the assumption of aquifer BC. Two approximating functions are tested here, one employing quadratic approximation of the hydraulic head (flux is linear), the other cubic approximation. Two different BC are also tested, one leading to linear flow, the other strongly nonlinear flow. For both BC, the estimated conductivities converge to the true values with grid refinement, and the solution is accurate and stable when a sufficient number of the observation data is used. Compared to the quadratic function, the cubic function leads to a faster convergence of the estimated conductivity at a lower level of grid discretization, while it is also more robust for the different flow conditions tested. A sensitivity analysis is conducted whereby the inversion accuracy is evaluated against data density. Composite scale sensitivity (CSS) can reveal the overall information content of the data. However, when the number of measurements is fixed, CSS cannot reveal whether the observed data can lead to reliable conductivity estimates. A one-observation-at-a-time (OAT) approach is proposed, which can indicate the reliability of the estimated conductivity for a given set of the observation data. To evaluate the stability of the method when the observation data contain errors, a problem with  hydrofacies conductivities is inverted using hydraulic heads and a single Darcy flux component. The results are accurate when the measurement error is small but become slightly less accurate when the error is larger. In summary, flow condition, inverse formulation, grid discretization, observation data density and location, and measurement errors all influence the accuracy of inversion.", (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Simple examples are used to illustrate that even theoretically convergent schemes can produce numerical steady state solutions that do not correspond to steady state solutions of the boundary value problem. This phenomenon must be considered in any computational study of nonunique solutions to partial differential equations that govern physical systems such as fluid flows. In particular, numerical calculations have been used to ""suggest"" that certain Euler equations do not have a unique solution. For Burgers' equation on a finite spatial interval with Neumann boundary conditions the only steady state solutions axe constant (in space) functions. Moreover, according to recent theoretical results, for any initial condition the corresponding solution to Burgers' equation must converge to a constant as t--> infinity. However, we present a convergent finite difference scheme that produces false nonconstant numerical steady state ""solutions."" These erroneous solutions arise out of the necessary finite floating point arithmetic inherent in every digital computer. We suggest the resulting numerical steady state solution may be viewed as a solution to a ""nearby"" boundary value problem with high sensitivity to changes in the boundary conditions.

However, limited attention is given to lowland braided rivers where the transport of suspended sediment plays a dominant role. In the present study, a numerical model based on the basic physics laws of hydrodynamics and sediment transport is used to simulate the evolution process of a braided river dominated by suspended load transport. The model employs a fractional method to simulate the transport of graded sediments and uses a multiple-bed-layer approach to represent the sediment sorting process. An idealized braided river has been produced, with the hydrodynamic, sediment transport and morphological processes being analysed. In particular, the formation process of local pool-bar units in the predicted river has been investigated. A sensitivity analysis has also been undertaken to investigate the effects of grid resolution and an upstream perturbation on the model prediction. A variety of methods are applied to analyse the geometrical and topographical properties of the modelled river. Self-organizing characteristics related to river geometry and topography are analysed by state-space plots, which indicate a close relationship with the periodical erosion and deposition cycles of braiding.

This is because they are effective, do not require gradient information, and one can easily combine this type of algorithm, with any finite element structural analysis code. The purpose of this paper is to develop a CA algorithm based on novel local rules oriented at solving compliance-based topology optimization problems. Design/methodology/approach - The design domain is divided into lattice of cells, states of which are updated synchronously. The proposed rules include information coming from an individual cell and from its neighborhood, and by introducing weighting parameters allow to control and modify topology generation process. Findings - The performance of the developed algorithm is very satisfactory, and a comparison with results of other authors, obtained with the use of various optimization techniques, shows efficiency of the present topology generation process. The results found within approach of this paper are in a good agreement with the ones already reported, both for optimal topologies and values of minimal compliance, which in some cases are found even improved. Practical implications - The algorithm presented in the paper is quite general what allows its easy application to engineering design problems. Moreover, the local update rules are simple, so they can be easily implemented into professional FEM analysis codes, as an efficient add-on module for topology optimization. Originality/value - The main advantage of the developed algorithm is that it is a fast convergent technique and usually requires far less iterations as to achieve the solution, when compared to other approaches.

These schemes have a technical challenge that the generalized travel time including tolls on a path is nonadditive. First, it shows that the perturbed logit-based network flows-link and entry-exit flows-are implicit but continuously differentiable functions with respect to the perturbation parameters arising from link travel time functions, origin-destination demands, and entry-exit tolls. Second, this article derives elegant analytical expressions of gradients of perturbed logit-based SUE network flows, and elaborates that these gradients can be calculated by the two-stage stochastic network loading algorithm, which obviates the need for path enumeration.

The procedure is so general that it enables sensitivity analysis for potential and elasticity problems within both homogeneous and heterogeneous plane and D problems. The essential difference with respect to the previous approaches like the Direct Differentiation Method or the Adjoint Variable Method is in discrete evaluation of the structural response using the response polynomials of some state parameters and design variable as the independent parameter. Such a determination is carried out via the several solutions of the given boundary value problem, where design parameter mean value is regularly perturbed in each of the solutions to cover the closest neighborhood of this mean value. Those few solutions make it possible to recover the polynomial response function from node-to node within the boundary elements, so that further symbolic differentiation using MAPLE returns the sensitivity gradients particular values. The entire procedure is tested here twice-first example deals with the homogeneous cantilever beam, where comparison against pure analytical differentiation is done and, separately, for two-component composite cantilever, where such a comparison is made against the central difference method linked with the same BEM solution.",,"Kaminski, M",STRUCTURAL AND MULTIDISCIPLINARY OPTIMIZATION,structural design sensitivity boundary element method polynomial response function composite materials,10.1007/s00158-009-0402-4

Different acute bioassays (Daphnia magna immobilization; microalgae growth inhibition; germination and growth of lettuce and oat) were carried out with simulated leachates, pore water and soil samples. The germination and growth of native shrubs (Cistus ladanifer and Lavandula sampaioana) were also evaluated in the lysimeters where S. purpurea had grown. The soil had high total concentrations (g/kg) of Al (.-.), As (.-.), Cu (.-.) and Pb (.-.). However, the percentages of elements in aqueous extracts (simulating leachates, pore water, and the conditions of the rhizosphere soil) were small when compared to their total soil concentrations (less than % except for Na in leachates). Growth of S. purpurea and other natural colonization of plant species (Poaceae, Fabaceae and Asteraceae families) improved chemical characteristics but the application of the polyacrylate polymers contributed to a further improvement of soil quality. However, this was not sufficient to ensure the growth of a large number of shrubs despite a great germination rate. Among the several species used on the ecotoxicological assessment, the D. magna test was the only bioassay that showed a clear toxicity of soil leachates, suggesting the importance of using several ecotoxicological tests to assess the environmental risk of soil contamination and its rehabilitation. Although the studied soil can be considered contaminated taking into account the total soil concentrations of Al, As, Cu and Pb, the low concentrations of the same chemical elements in extractable solutions, that simulated the fractions really available for organisms, did not demonstrate a substantial toxic effects in the organisms and, consequently, negative impact on the environment.", (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Biochars (BCs) and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are known to bind metals, and metallophyte can remove metals from soils. Will BC in combination with AMF contain the Cu uptake by a metallophyte growing in a metal-contaminated soil? The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of BCs on the Cu immobilization and over soil microbial communities in a metal-contaminated soil in the presence of AMF and metallophyte. Two BCs were produced from chicken manure (CMB) and oat hull (OHB). A Cu-contaminated sandy soil ( mg kg(-)) was incubated with CMB and OHB (, , and  % w/w) for  weeks. Metallophyte Oenothera picensis was grown in pots ( mL) containing the incubated soils in a controlled greenhouse for  months. A number of analyses were conducted after the harvest. These include plant biomass weight, microbial basal respiration, and dehydrogenase activity (DHA), AMF root colonization, spore number, and glomalin production; changes in fungal and bacterial communities, Cu fractions in soil phases, and Cu uptake in plant tissues. The BCs increased the soil pH, decreased easily exchangeable fraction of Cu, and increased organic matter and residual fraction of Cu. The BCs provided favorable habitat for microorganisms, thereby increasing basal respiration. The CMB increased DHA by similar to  and similar to  %, respectively, for the low and high doses. Similarly, the OHB increased soil microbial activity by similar to  and similar to  %, respectively, for the low and high doses. AMF root colonization, spore number, and total glomalin-related soil protein (GRSP) production increased by similar to , similar to , and similar to  times, respectively, in soils treated with  % OHB. Despite being a metalophyte, O. picensis could not uptake Cu efficiently. Root and shoot Cu concentrations decreased or changed insignificantly in most BC treatments. The results show that the BCs decreased bioavailable Cu, decreased Cu uptake by O. picensis, improved habitat for microorganisms, and enhanced plant growth in Cu-contaminated soil. This suggests that biochars may be utilized to remediate Cu-contaminated soils.",,"Meier, S|Curaqueo, G|Khan, N|Bolan, N|Rilling, J|Vidal, C|Fernandez, N|Acuna, J|Gonzalez, ME|Cornejo, P|Borie, F",JOURNAL OF SOILS AND SEDIMENTS,arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi biochar contamination copper immobilization microorganism,10.1007/s11368-015-1224-1

Design/methodology/approach - Arriving customers follow a Poisson process and require the first essential service (FES). As soon as FES of a customer is completed, the customer may leave the system or opt for the second optional service (SOS). The service times of FES channel and SOS channel are assumed to be general distribution functions. The server requires a startup time with random length before starting service. When the server is working, he may meet unpredictable breakdowns but is immediately repaired. The inter-breakdown time and repair time of the removable server are exponentially random variable and generally random variable, respectively. By the convex combination property and the renewal reward theorem, several system performances are obtained. A cost model is developed to search the optimal two-threshold policy at a minimum cost. Sensitivity analysis is performed. Findings - Expressions for various system performances are derived. Sensitivity analysis of optimal randomized control policy (based on the developed expected cost function) with respect to system parameters is investigated. Originality/value - It is the first time that analytic results of sensitivity analysis of optimal randomized control policy for the complex system have been obtained which is quite useful and significant for engineers.",,"Yang, DY|Wang, KH|Ke, JC|Pearn, WL",ENGINEERING COMPUTATIONS,sensitivity analysis optimal control,10.1108/02644400810909616

Despite being an extreme event with high uncertainty, the rainfall-run-off process is often regarded as deterministic (rather than stochastic). In this paper, the Soil Conservation Service (SCS) flood hydrograph uncertainty is quantified based on the Total Error Framework (TEF), and introduced into the model by applying perturbation in the input data and model parameters. The random perturbation component is stochastically modelled. A sensitivity analysis was carried out on the stochastic model parameters, using a real case study in the Azores (Portugal). The results showed that the flood hydrograph uncertainty varies over time, with its largest deviations occurring at the beginning of the flooding because of the uncertainty associated with the SCS method curve number parameter (correlation coefficient R- of .). Rainfall uncertainty was responsible for the uncertainty in the hydrograph peaks' magnitude (R-=.) while uncertainty in the propagation velocity was responsible for the uncertainty in the peaks' time (R-=.).",,"Leandro, J|Leitao, JP|de Lima, JLMP",JOURNAL OF FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT,flash flooding lack of data scs method stochastic models uncertainty,10.1111/jfr3.12010

Model performance was tested using high frequency measurements over three years; additionally a local sensitivity analysis was performed. Annual NO emissions of . and . kg N ha(-) year(-) were simulated from mown-grassland and grain-cropland, respectively. Measured and simulated water filled pore space (r=., ME=-.%) and soil temperature (r=., ME=-. degrees C) at  cm soil depth matched well in mown-grassland. The model predicted cumulative hay and crop production effectively. The model simulated soil mineral nitrogen (N) concentrations, particularly ammonium (NH+), reasonably, but the model significantly underestimated soil nitrate (NO-) concentration under both systems. In general, the model effectively simulated the dynamics and the magnitude of daily NO flux over the whole experimental period in grain-cropland (r= ., ME=-. g N ha(-) day(-)), with reasonable agreement between measured and modelled NO fluxes for the mown-grassland (r = ., ME=-. g N ha(-) day(-)). Our results indicate that DailyDayCent has potential for use as a tool for predicting overall NO emissions in the study region. However, in-depth analysis shows some systematic discrepancies between measured and simulated NO fluxes on a daily basis. The current exercise suggests that the DailyDayCent may need improvement, particularly the sub-module responsible for N transformations, for better simulating soil mineral N, especially soil NO- concentration, and NO flux on a daily basis. The sensitivity analysis shows that many factors such as climate change, N-fertilizer use, input uncertainty and parameter value could influence the simulation of NO emissions.

() is based on one-at-n-time perturbations to the model parameters. This type of analysis cannot highlight the presence of parameter interactions which might indeed affect the characteristics of the flood frequency curve (ffc) even more than the individual parameters. For this reason, the effects of the parameters of the rainfall, rainfall runoff models and of the potential evapotranspiration demand on the ffc are investigated here through an analysis of the results obtained from a factorial experimental design, where all the parameters are allowed to vary simultaneously. This latter, more complex, analysis confirms the results obtained in Hashemi ct al. () thus making the conclusions drawn there of Rider validity and not related strictly to the reference set selected. However, it is shown that two-factor interactions are present not only between different pairs of parameters of an individual model, but also between pairs of parameters of different models, such as rainfall and rainfall-runoff models, thus demonstrating the complex interaction between climate and basin characteristics affecting the ffc and in particular its curvature. Furthermore, the wider range of climatic regime behaviour produced within the factorial experimental design shows that the probability distribution of soil moisture content at the storm arrival time is no longer sufficient to explain the link between the perturbations to the parameters and their effects on the ffc, as was suggested in Hashemi et al. ().

In practical circumstances where experiments are time-consuming or resource-intensive, OED can yield enormous savings. We pursue OED for nonlinear systems from a Bayesian perspective, with the goal of choosing experiments that are optimal for parameter inference. Our objective in this context is the expected information gain in model parameters, which in general can only be estimated using Monte Carlo methods. Maximizing this objective thus becomes a stochastic optimization problem. This paper develops gradient-based stochastic optimization methods for the design of experiments on a continuous parameter space. Given a Monte Carlo estimator of expected information gain, we use infinitesimal perturbation analysis to derive gradients of this estimator. We are then able to formulate two gradient-based stochastic optimization approaches: (i) Robbins-Monro stochastic approximation, and (ii) sample average approximation combined with a deterministic quasi-Newton method. A polynomial chaos approximation of the forward model accelerates objective and gradient evaluations in both cases. We discuss the implementation of these optimization methods, then conduct an empirical comparison of their performance.

As a part of performance evaluation, the soil characteristics and plant growth response of the untreated and treated soil were examined. The soil treated at  degrees C retained most of its original soil properties, hut the soil treated at  degrees C exhibited considerable changes in mineralogical composition and physicochemical characteristics. Growth and physiological response of the three plant species radish (Raphanus sativus L.), fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.), and oat (Avena sativa L.) indicated adverse effects of the thermal treatment. The addition of N fertilizer had beneficial effects in the  degrees C treated soil, hut had little beneficial effects in the  degrees C treated soil. Some changes of soil characteristics induced by thermal treatment cannot be avoided. Soil characteristics and phytotoxicity test results strongly suggest that changes occurring following the  degrees C treatment do not limit the use of the treated soil to refill the excavated site for full-scale remediation.

The influence of several design parameters on its thermal behaviour and performance is investigated by parametric sensitivity analysis (PSA) using a dimensionless model for an infinite length reactor. Reactor temperature sensitivity with respect to ratio of inlet velocities, inlet temperature, ratio of pre-exponential factors, difference in activation energies, and heat effect numbers is investigated. It is demonstrated that different catalysts can show similar thermal behaviour and performance but exhibit different sensitivity behaviour. The latter is mainly influenced by the activation energies and the inlet temperature. It was found that the most sensitive behaviour is obtained during cold spot rather than hot spot or isothermal operation.

Grain image boundary contours were extracted from the digital images of kernels, expressed as chain-coded points and then approximated by  elliptic Fourier coefficients. After normalization of the size, rotation and starting point of the contours, four groups of coefficients namely; invariant, symmetrical, asymmetric and standardized Fourier coefficients were analyzed separately using PCA. The PCA based on the symmetric Fourier coefficients captured the shape variability of different grains with fewer principal components (PCs) than the rest. Results suggest that the major shape variations of grains can be summarized by the first two, five, eight and seventeen PCs of the symmetric, standardized, invariant and asymmetric Fourier coefficients, respectively, capturing about % of shape variations.

In the last years, efforts to conserve and value ecosystem services have been fomented. By way of illustration, the Natural Capital Project integrates ecosystem services into everyday decision making around the world. This project has developed InVEST (a system for Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs). The InVEST model is a spatially integrated modelling tool that allows us to predict changes in ecosystem services, biodiversity conservation and commodity production levels. Here, InVEST model is applied to a stakeholder-defined scenario of land-use/land-cover change in a Mediterranean region basin (the Llobregat basin, Catalonia. Spain). Of all InVEST modules and sub-modules, only the behaviour of the water provisioning one is investigated in this article. The main novel aspect of this work is the sensitivity analysis (SA) carried out to the InVEST model in order to determine the variability of the model response when the values of three of its main coefficients: Z (seasonal precipitation distribution), prec (annual precipitation) and eto (annual evapotranspiration), change. The SA technique used here is a One-At-a-Time (OAT) screening method known as Morris method, applied over each one of the one hundred and fifty four sub-watersheds in which the Llobregat River basin is divided. As a result, this method provides three sensitivity indices for each one of the sub-watersheds under consideration, which are mapped to study how they are spatially distributed. From their analysis, the study shows that, in the case under consideration and between the limits considered for each factor, the effect of the Z coefficient on the model response is negligible, while the other two need to be accurately determined in order to obtain precise output variables.

The results of this work indicated that initial uptake of Eu+ was highest within the undifferentiated cells of the root tip just behind the root cap, a region of maximal cell growth and differentiation and with incomplete formation of the Casparian strip around the central vascular cylinder. Distribution of assimilated Eu+ within the root's differentiation and elongation zone was nonuniform. Higher concentrations of Eu+ were observed within the vascular cylinder, specifically in the phloem and developing xylem parenchyma. Elevated levels of the metal were also observed in the root hairs of the mature root zone. Fluorescence spectroscopic characteristics of the assimilated Eu+ suggested that the Eu+ exists as inner-sphere mononuclear complexes inside the root. This work also demonstrated the effectiveness of a time-resolved Eu+ fluorescence spectroscopy and confocal fluorescence profiling techniques for the in vivo, real-time study of metal [Eu+] accumulation by a functioning intact plant root.

This paper presents an assessment framework that allows the identification of adaptation strategies that are robust (i.e. insensitive) to climate change uncertainties. The framework is applied to a case study of water resources management in the East of England, more specifically to the Anglian Water Services'  year Water Resource Plan (WRP). The paper presents a local sensitivity analysis (a 'one-at-a-time' experiment) of the various elements of the modelling framework (e.g., emissions of greenhouse gases, climate sensitivity and global climate models) in order to determine whether or not a decision to adapt to climate change is sensitive to uncertainty in those elements. Water resources are found to be sensitive to uncertainties in regional climate response (from general circulation models and dynamical downscaling), in climate sensitivity and in climate impacts. Aerosol forcing and greenhouse gas emissions uncertainties are also important, whereas uncertainties from ocean mixing and the carbon cycle are not. Despite these large uncertainties, Anglian Water Services' WRP remains robust to the climate change uncertainties sampled because of the adaptation options being considered (e.g. extension of water treatment works), because the climate model used for their planning (HadCM) predicts drier conditions than other models, and because 'one-at-a-time' experiments do not sample the combination of different extremes in the uncertainty range of parameters. This research raises the question of how much certainty is required in climate change projections to justify investment in adaptation measures, and whether such certainty can be delivered.

This is the first report of the Leighton ratio in China, with relatively high recorded values of . +/- . (Backgarden) and . +/- .

Thinning of an ice shelf reduces its ability to restrain the ice discharge from the grounded ice sheet. However, our understanding of how ice shelf processes couple ice-sheet changes to climate variability is still rudimentary. In part, this is due to the brevity and low temporal resolution of surveys of ice shelf thickness relative to the broad range of time scales on which ice-sheet mass fluctuates. Here, we present improved procedures to construct -year (-) time series of Antarctic ice shelf surface height at high spatial resolution (similar to  km) by merging data from three overlapping satellite radar altimeter missions (ERS-, ERS-, and Envisat). We apply an averaging scheme to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio of height changes over the floating ice shelves, and extract low-order polynomial trends using a robust approach (regularized regression with cross-validation) that accounts for both bias and variance in the fit. We construct formal confidence intervals by bootstrap resampling of the residuals of the fit. The largest source of height error arises from the interaction of the radar signal with the snow and firn surface; on annual time scales, changes in surface and sub-surface scattering and radar penetration lead to apparent height changes that are larger than the true surface-height change arising from densification. Our -year time series of surface height provide an insight into how ice shelves respond to the changing atmospheric and oceanic conditions.

As a first step of our analysis, a sensitivity analysis was carried out using automatic relevance determination scheme to examine the relative influence of each of the hydro-meteorological attributes on groundwater level fluctuations. Secondly, the result of stability analysis was studied by perturbing the underlying data sets with different levels of correlated red noise. Finally, guided by the ensuing theoretical experiments, the above techniques were applied to model the groundwater level fluctuation time series of six wells from a hard rock area of Dindigul in Southern India. We used four standard quantitative statistical measures to compare the robustness of the different models. These measures are () root mean square error, () reduction of error, () index of agreement (IA), and () Pearson's correlation coefficient (R). Based on the above analyses, it is found that the ANFIS model performed better in modeling noise-free data than the BNN.SCG and ANN.SCG models. However, modeling of hydrological time series correlated with significant amount of red noise, the BNN.SCG models performed better than both the ANFIS and ANN.SCG models. Hence, appropriate care should be taken for selecting suitable methodology for modeling the complex and noisy hydrological time series.

In contrast to mathematical models in previous research work in which, bacteria were typically treated as immobile colloids, this model incorporated a convective-like chemotaxis term to represent chemotactic migration. Consistency between experimental observation and model prediction supported the assertions that () dispersion-induced microbial transfer between adjacent conductive zones occurred at the interface and had little influence on bacterial transport in the bulk flow of tie permeable layers and () the enhanced transverse bacterial migration in chemotactic experiments relative to nonchemotactic controls was mainly due to directed migration toward the chemical source zone. On the basis of parameter sensitivity analysis, chemotactic parameters determined in bulk aqueous fluid were adequate to predict the microbial transport in our intermediate-scale porous media system. Additionally, the analysis of adsorption coefficient values supported the observation of a previous study that microbial deposition to the surface of porous media might be decreased under the effect of chemoattractant gradients.

Application to karst spring discharge models,FRANCE PERFORMANCE VALIDATION CATCHMENT FONTAINE ERROR,"In this paper the perturbation approach is used to investigate the analytical properties of the sensitivity to the initial conditions on the calibration and simulation results of two karst spring discharge reservoir models. The propagation of uncertainty in the initial conditions is shown to depend on both model structure and the values assumed by state variables at the beginning of simulation. Depending on model structure, non-linearity may either hasten or delay the dissipation of the initialisation bias. In particular, threshold-based transfer functions are shown to generate Dirac sensitivity patterns. When associated with long-term memory reservoir and fast discharge models, they may generate a substantial initialisation bias even after very long periods of inactivity. As a practical consequence, the commonly-used one year warm-up period may not be sufficient to dissipate the initialisation bias. Calibration results may be impacted significantly. A careful examination of the initialisation bias behaviour should be part of ""good modelling practice"". In particular, the use of elaborate procedures for locating the global optimum of the objective function used for parameter optimization can only be justified in so far as the initialisation bias has been efficiently eliminated. This study advocates the use of local sensitivity analysis as a low-computational cost tool to identify the main characteristics of the bias behaviour, even for conceptual models with strongly non-linear transfer functions.

Combining with the tectonic explanation of spatial and temporal continuity of the abnormal phenomena, along with the analysed results, a number of anomalies could be associated with possible seismic activities, which follow the same time and space. Therefore, we conclude that the anomalies observed from  March  to  April , about eight days before the Abruzzo earthquake, could be earthquake anomalies",,"Xiong, P|Gu, XF|Bi, YX|Shen, XH|Meng, QY|Zhao, LM|Kang, CL|Chen, LZ|Jing, F|Yao, N|Zhao, YH|Li, XM|Li, Y|Dong, JT",NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES,,10.5194/nhess-13-2065-2013

This requires subjective judgements on the importance of different criteria by DMs and increases uncertainty in decision making. This article demonstrates how uncertainty can be handled in multi-criteria decision situations using Compromise Programming, one of the Multi-criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) techniques. Uncertainty is characterised using a probabilistic approach and propagated using a Monte Carlo simulation technique. The methodological approach is illustrated on a case study which compares the sustainability of two options for electricity generation: coal versus biomass. Different models have been used to quantify their sustainability performance for a number of economic, environmental and social criteria. Three cases are considered with respect to uncertainty: () no uncertainty, () uncertainty in data/models and () uncertainty in models and decision-makers' preferences. The results shows how characterising and propagating uncertainty can help increase the effectiveness of multi-criteria decision making processes and lead to more informed decision.",,"Dorini, G|Kapelan, Z|Azapagic, A",CLEAN TECHNOLOGIES AND ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY,uncertainty analysis multi-criteria decision analysis monte carlo simulation compromise programming sustainability assessment,10.1007/s10098-010-0291-7

In an economic production quantity (EPQ) model, lead-time plays a significant role in ensuring that the manufacturing process starts on time. As we know, when both lead-time and demand rate are deterministic and constant, then demand during the lead-time is constant, and is referred to as zero lead-time. Moreover, when either or both of them are random variables, then lead-time demand (LTD) is a random variable. In such a case, a crucial question is: ""when should the order be placed?"" On the other hand, the distributional information on demand may not always be available or there may be many distribution functions in the practice, which have same mean and variance, but their frequencies are different. In this study, we develop an EPQ model in stochastic framework, wherein the distribution function of demand is unknown, but the mean and variance are known. The inventory level is continuously reviewed, and an order is placed when it reaches the reorder level. The real-life business situations are so sophisticated and floating in nature that the consideration of 'impreciseness' along with 'statistical variability' in demand parameter is more preferable. To be a part of this contingency, we further extend the model in the fuzzy random environment by considering demand rate as a fuzzy random variable (FRV). Furthermore, we mathematically analyze the cost function and propose a heuristic procedure to find the global optimum. Numerical examples with sensitivity analysis are also provided for illustration purpose. (C) ", Elsevier Ltd.

Another objective was to detect the effect of cadmium contamination of soil on the content of cadmium in the dry mass of oat panicles, stems, upper green and bottom yellow leaves and roots. The soil contamination was applied in the forms of nitrate Cd(NO)(), chloride CdCl and sulphate CdSO-. High correlation was found between the measured levels of photosynthesis rate, stomatal conductivity and transpiration rates, but no correlation occurred between these levels and the cadmium content in leaves. In the variants with Cd contamination, insignificantly higher levels of photosynthesis rates were observed in the measurements than in the zero variant. A -fold higher Cd application dose significantly manifested itself by a higher content of Cd in all the analyzed parts of plants, including generative organs. A several-fold higher Cd level was found in the roots than in other parts of the plant, whereas the lowest Cd content was observed in panicles. However, the results obtained by measuring the cadmium content in stems and green leaves were not significant. In most treatments, a notably higher Cd content was determined in bottom yellow leaves than in upper green leaves. This indicates Cd accumulation in senescent tissues and its difficult reutilization. The highest variance was discovered in treatments with the accompanying SO- anion. While estimating the effect of accompanying anions on the Cd content, significant differences were observed only under the higher level of Cd contamination. The increase in the Cd content in bottom yellow leaves after CdSO application was significant when compared with the treatment in which Cd(NO)() was applied and insignificant versus the variant with CdCl.

In this study, a conditional nonlinear optimal perturbation related to parameter (CNOP-P) approach and a sophisticated land surface model (the Common Land Model, CoLM) are employed in four regions in China to explore extent of uncertainty in soil moisture simulations due to model parameter errors. The CNOP-P approach facilitates calculation of the upper bounds of uncertainty due to parameter errors and investigation of the nonlinear effects of parameter combination on uncertainties in simulation and prediction. The range of uncertainty for simulated soil moisture was found to be from . to . m() m(-). Based on the CNOP-P approach, a new approach is applied to explore a relatively sensitive and important parameter combination for soil moisture simulations and predictions. It is found that the relatively sensitive parameter combination is region- and season-dependent. Furthermore, the results show that simulation of soil moisture could be improved if the errors in these important parameter combinations are reduced. In four study regions, the average extent of improvement (.%) in simulating soil moisture using the new approach based on the CNOP-P is larger than that (.%) using the one-at-a-time (OAT) approach.

Winter annual grass cover crops can conserve residual soil N; however, their ability to recover N greatly varies with management. A two-year field experiment in the North Carolina Coastal Plain on a State fine sandy loam (fine-loamy, mixed, thermic Typic Hapludult) compared dry matter (DM), N accumulation, and soil inorganic N following rye (Secale cereale L.), winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), triticale (Triticum secale L.), black oats (Avena strigosa L.), and fallow (native weeds) in relation to planting (October, November, and December) and growth termination (early March, early April, and late April/early May) dates and levels of residual soil N. Cover crop DM and N accumulations decreased with successive planting date delays (November and December) for each growth termination date in the following spring. In , cumulative DM yields of October-and November-planted cover crops were . Mg ha(-) (. tn ac(-)) and . Mg ha(-) (. tn ac(-)), respectively, which were significantly greater than those of December-planted cover crops (. Mg ha(-) [. tn ac(-)]) at the second growth termination date (early April). Cover crop N accumulation increased with a delay in growth termination, although the interaction between cover crop species and the planting date varied. October planting of rye and triticale showed greater N accumulation at a March growth termination date, averaging . kg N ha(-) (. lb N ac(-)) for rye and . kg N ha(-) (. lb N ac(-)) for triticale; these values were .% and .% higher than those of black oat and wheat, respectively, at the same planting and growth termination dates.

In contrast, black oat showed a greater ability to scavenge soil residual N with a late planting and growth termination date combination (average, . kg N ha(-) [. lb N ac(-)]). The cover crop planting date affected soil inorganic N distribution at each termination date, with an October planting date resulting in lower soil profile inorganic N levels than November and December planting dates. Lower soil inorganic N concentrations were strongly associated with increases in cover crop DM and N accumulation for each growth termination date.

Six small watersheds (ranging from  to ha) within two southwestern Wisconsin farm sites (Discovery Farms Program (DFP) and Pioneer Farm (PF)) were instrumented, and surface runoff was continuously monitored from  to . The soils in all watersheds were formed in deep (similar to m) loessial sites. A direct-plant management strategy and corn-soybean crop rotation were utilized within watersheds at DFP. A conventional tillage system (chisel plow in the fall followed by soil finisher in the spring) and a corn-oat-alfalfa crop rotation were utilized within watersheds at PF. At PF, the amount of precipitation leaving the landscape as surface runoff (.%) was two times greater compared to DFP (.%), indicating that the direct-plant management system was better at retaining precipitation than the chisel plow/soil finisher system. Using breakpoint regression analysis, a non-linear response in runoff generation with antecedent soil moisture (ASM) was observed with a threshold ASM of . cm()cm(-) (approximately % of total porosity) for all six watersheds. Below this threshold, runoff coefficients were near zero. Above this threshold, runoff coefficients increased with ASM.

Although sensitivities with respect to the first ones can easily be carried out as in topology optimization, the semi-analytical method (SAM) is often used for sensitivity analysis with respect to the location design variables. Due to the geometric perturbation of the finite element mesh, the latter can then be regarded as a geometric perturbation model (GPM). In this paper, we propose a material perturbation model (MPM) using fixed finite element (FE) mesh for sensitivity analysis with respect to location design variables. The material discontinuity across the boundary between each component and the framework structure is smoothed approximately by means of a modified Heaviside function. When a location design variable of a certain component is perturbed, attached finite elements to the component boundary are assumed to undertake only a shift of material properties while the finite element mesh itself remains geometrically unchanged. As a result, analytical sensitivities with respect to location design variables are achieved as easily as for pseudo-density variables. The computing efficiency is thus improved because the velocity field for the mesh perturbation in the semi-analytical scheme is no longer needed. The MPM is illustrated by means of numerical tests, especially the design optimization of D multi-component systems.", (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

We hypothesized, however, that the leaching pattern of the main ions may differ regarding their potential contribution to the total salt discharge. The experiment was conducted near Madrid in Spain on a typical Xerofluvent soil with sandy-loam texture in the first . m. For  years, a traditional crop rotation of corn-wheat-corn-oat (Zea mays L.-Triticum aestivum L.-Zea mays L.-Avena sativa L.) was planted and two irrigation treatments (traditional and improved) were applied only to the corn. In an experimental set-up of  plots, samples of the soil solutions were extracted  times during the experiment at soil depths of ., . and . m. During the experiment, drainage volume was estimated in plots under the two irrigation schedules. Main ions in the soil solution were SO-, Cl-supercript stop, Ca+, Na+ and HCO-. These solutes accounted for % of total salt discharge under the two irrigation treatments. Two main patterns of salt leaching were observed. For most main ions, except HCO-, the input to discharge ratio was lower than one. Also for HCO-, the irrigation treatment did not affect the leaching pattern (higher input than discharge under the two irrigation treatments). Improved irrigation schedules can be implemented without increasing the total salt load, but attention should be paid to specific leaching patterns of individual ions.",,"Bustos, A|Caballero, R|Roman, R",IRRIGATION SCIENCE,,10.1007/s00271-006-0029-9
284,WOS:000244915100001,2007,A strategy for input estimation with sensitivity analysis,ERROR CONTROL IDENTIFICATION FORCES,"The estimation of unknown excitation or input signals from measured response is essentially the solution of an optimization problem; a function representing the input is sought such that the discrepancy between measured and simulated response is minimized. From the view of optimization it is convenient to consider the general situation where the governing differential equations may be time-variant and non-linear. Moreover, the choice of parameterization for the sought input, sampling instances of measurement data and discretization of the state problem are all decoupled, in contrast to standard methods such as Dynamic Programming. In this paper, the optimization problem is solved by seeking a stationary point of the pertinent Lagrangian functional, resulting in a Newton-type iterative algorithm. Moreover, the sensitivity of the solution with respect to measurement noise may also be estimated from a perturbation analysis of the optimality conditions. Two numerical examples show that the approach produces results in agreement with those of standard methods, however, with the additional advantage the numerical properties of the considered problem may be investigated. In particular, such knowledge may be used for choosing a proper amount of regularization."," Copyright (c) 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Nordstrom, LJL|Johansson, H|Larsson, F",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUMERICAL METHODS IN ENGINEERING,load identification inverse problems sensitivity regularization,10.1002/nme.1845

The level set method is used to represent the structural boundaries and the boundary mesh is generated based on iso-surface of the level set function. A major novel aspect of this paper is that the governing equation is solved without ersatz material approach and approximated heat convection boundary condition by using the mesh generation. Additionally, the objective functional is defined also on the design boundaries. First, the topology optimization method and the level set method are briefly discussed. Using the level set based boundary expression, the topology optimization problem for the heat transfer problem with heat transfer boundary condition is formulated. Next, the topological derivative of the objective functional is derived. Finally, several numerical examples are provided to confirm the validity of the derived topological derivative and the proposed optimum design method. (C) ", Elsevier Ltd.

In , limit values were issued by the EU commission to avoid health risks by mycotoxins, both for humans and animals. This increased the need to develop tools for early detection of infections. Occurrence of Fusarium-caused head blight disease can be detected by spectral analysis (- nm) before harvest. With this information, farmers could recognize Fusarium contaminations. They could, therefore, harvest the grains separately and supply it to other utilizations, if applicable. In the present study, wheat plants were analyzed using a hyper-spectral imaging system under laboratory conditions. Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to differentiate spectra of diseased and healthy ear tissues in the wavelength ranges of - nm, - nm, - nm and - nm, respectively. Head blight could be successfully recognized during the development stages (BBCH-stages) -. However, the best time for disease determination was at the beginning of medium milk stage (BBCH ). Just after start of flowering (BBCH ) and, again, in the fully ripe stage (BBCH ), distinction by spectral analysis is impossible. With the imaging analysis method 'Spectral Angle Mapper' (SAM) the degree of disease was correctly classified (%) considering an error of visual rating of %. However, SAM is time-consuming. It involves both the analysis of all spectral bands and the setup of reference spectra for classification. The application of specific spectral sub-ranges is a very promising alternative. The derived head blight index (HBI), which uses spectral differences in the ranges of - nm and - nm, can be a suitable outdoor classification method for the recognition of head blight. In these experiments, mean hit rates were % during the whole study period (BBCH -). However, if only the optimal classification time is considered, the accuracy of detection can be largely increased.", (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Our model is an extension of a previous work by Barker [Barker, J.A., . A generalized radial flow model for hydraulic tests in fractured rock. Water Resources Research  (), -; Butter Jr., J.J., Zhan X., . Hydraulic tests in highly permeable aquifers. Water Resources Research , W. doi:.//WR]. It includes inertial effects at both test and observation wells and a fractional flow dimension in the aquifer. The model has five fitting parameters: flow dimension n, hydraulic conductivity K, specific storage coefficient Ss, and effective lengths of test well Le and of observation well Le,. The results of a sensitivity analysis show that the most sensitive parameter is the flow dimension n. The model sensitivity to other parameters may be ranked as follows: K > Le similar to Le(o)) > Ss. The sensitivity to aquifer storage remains one or two orders of magnitude tower than that to other parameters. The model has been coupled to an automatic inversion algorithm for facilitating the interpretation of real field data. This inversion algorithm is based on a Gauss-Newton optimization procedure conditioned by re-scaled sensitivities. It has been used to interpret successfully cross-borehole slug test data from the Hydrogeological Experimental Site (HES) of Poitiers, France, consisting of fractured and karstic limestones. HES data provide flow dimension values ranging between . and ., and hydraulic conductivity values ranging between . x (-) and . x (-) m s(-). These values are consistent with previous interpretations of single-well slug tests. The results of the sensitivity analysis are confirmed by calculations of relative errors on parameter estimates, which show that accuracy on n and K is below % and that on Ss is about one order of magnitude. The K-values interpreted from cross-borehole slug tests are one order of magnitude higher than those previously interpreted from interference pumping tests. These findings suggest that cross-borehole slug tests focus on preferential flowpath networks made by fractures and karstic channels, i.e. the head perturbation induced by a slug test propagates only through those flowpaths with the lowest hydraulic resistance.

The constitutive HO scavenging enzyme activities and proline content in the leaves of drought-tolerant Xihan are higher than those in drought-sensitive Ningchun. Higher Pb concentration reduced chlorophyll content in both cultivars, but Ningchun was more sensitive to lead toxicity than Xihan. The higher activities of antioxidant enzyme and the significant proline accumulation provide protection for two wheat cultivars against lead toxicity, resulting in unaltered MDA content. Analysis of enzyme activities showed that the accumulation of proline induced by lead stress is due to the increases of OAT and GK activities in Xihan seedlings, and to the increase of GK activity in Ningchun leaves. Therefore, the different mechanism of proline metabolism was associated with increased proline levels in two wheat cultivars when exposed to lead stress.", (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

The composition of behavioral fields is carried out in a manner that is procedurally similar to composition of primitive geometrical entities through set theoretic Boolean operations in constructive solid geometry. The methodology is shown to lead to a tighter integration between design and analysis and is termed constructive solid analysis. A meshless approximation using non-uniform rational B-spline basis functions is used to discretize the behavioral fields defined over the geometrical primitives. Remeshing, which is a critical bottleneck in shape optimization using conventional finite element analysis is either eliminated or limited to those primitives that are modified. Further, it is demonstrated that the reconstruction of stiffness matrices is required only for those geometrical primitives that are affected by the design changes. Design sensitivity analysis techniques are developed for the discretized solution system arising out of the compositional analysis. An adaptive numerical integration scheme is developed and shown to be necessary to accurately compute the effect of small domain perturbations on the problem functions.

In south Uruguay, frequent tillage and little or no inputs of organic matter have resulted in soil degradation that threatens soil productivity and systems sustainability. This study aimed to quantify the impact of tillage, crop residue management, and organic matter incorporation on runoff, soil erosion, water dynamics, and productivity of a raised bed tomato-oat rotation system. A field trial was set up in  and replicated in  in a temperate climate on a fine textured soil including four soil management practices: reduced tillage with a cover crop left as mulch and chicken manure incorporation (RT), conventional tillage with a cover crop used as green manure and chicken manure incorporation (CGM), conventional tillage with chicken manure incorporation (CChM), and conventional tillage system as control (CT). RT decreased soil erosion and runoff by more than % compared with the three conventional tillage systems. We proposed a non-linear model to estimate the reduction in runoff due to stubble as a function of rainfall, with locally adjusted parameters. Yields under CChM were the largest both years, and more than % greater than under RT. Causes of low yields under RT are most likely poor crop establishment under the organic cover in combination with N immobilization. Compared with CChM water use efficiency under RT was reduced by % during the first season, and by % under both RT and CGM during the second season. In a dry season, RT increased soil water capture by % ( mm) compared with conventional tillage treatments. This is of special interest in these systems as it may result in a larger cultivated area of irrigation-dependent crops on a farm, thus building resilience to climate change.

This is particularly true in water resource studies that depend on model-based assessments of alternative management strategies. In recent decades, Bayesian data assimilation methods have been widely used in. hydrology to assess uncertain model parameters and predictions. In this case study, a particular data assimilation algorithm, the Ensemble Smoother with Multiple Data Assimilation (ESMDA) (Emerick and Reynolds, ), is used to derive posterior samples of uncertain model parameters and forecasts for a distributed hydrological model of Yanqi basin, China. This model is constructed using MIKESHE/MIKEsoftware, which provides for coupling between surface and subsurface processes (DHI, a-d). The random samples in the posterior parameter ensemble are obtained by using measurements to update  prior parameter samples generated with a Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) procedure. The posterior forecast samples are obtained from model runs that use the corresponding posterior parameter samples. Two iterative sample update methods are considered: one based on an a perturbed observation Kalman filter update and one based on a square root Kalman filter update. These alternatives give nearly the same results and converge in only two iterations. The uncertain parameters considered include hydraulic conductivities, drainage and river leakage factors, van Genuchten soil property parameters, and dispersion coefficients.

In this paper, based on experimental observations, a detailed dynamical model of bantam-regulated circadian clock system is developed to show the post-transcriptional behaviors in the modulation of Drosophila circadian rhythm, in which the regulation of bantam is incorporated into a classical model. The dynamical behaviors of the model are consistent with the experimental observations, which shows that bantam is an important regulator of Drosophila circadian rhythm. The sensitivity analysis of parameters demonstrates that with the regulation of bantam the system is more sensitive to perturbations, indicating that bantam regulation makes it easier for the organism to modulate its period against the environmental perturbations. The effectiveness in rescuing locomotor activity rhythms of mutated flies shows that bantam is necessary for strong and sustained rhythms.

We use a newly developed software package, a Problem Solving environment for Uncertainty Analysis and Design Exploration (PSUADE), to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of ten widely used SA methods, including seven qualitative and three quantitative ones. All SA methods are tested using a variety of sampling techniques to screen out the most sensitive (i.e., important) parameters from the insensitive ones. The Sacramento Soil Moisture Accounting (SAC-SMA) model, which has thirteen tunable parameters, is used for illustration. The South Branch Potomac River basin near Springfield, West Virginia in the U.S. is chosen as the study area. The key findings from this study are: () For qualitative SA methods, Correlation Analysis (CA), Regression Analysis (RA), and Gaussian Process (GP) screening methods are shown to be not effective in this example. Morris One-At-a-Time (MOAT) screening is the most efficient, needing only  samples to identify the most important parameters, but it is the least robust method. Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS), Delta Test (DT) and Sum-Of-Trees (SOT) screening methods need about - samples for the same purpose. Monte Carlo (MC), Orthogonal Array (OA) and Orthogonal Array based Latin Hypercube (OALH) are appropriate sampling techniques for them; () For quantitative SA methods, at least  samples are needed for Fourier Amplitude Sensitivity Test (FAST) to identity parameter main effect. McKay method needs about  samples to evaluate the main effect, more than  samples to assess the two-way interaction effect. OALH and LP tau (LPTAU) sampling techniques are more appropriate for McKay method. For the Sobol' method, the minimum samples needed are  to compute the first-order and total sensitivity indices correctly.

One attractive technical solution combines the three way catalytic functionality and the filter in one device, the so called 'catalysed Gasoline Particulate Filter'. The current study uses temperature step experiments and CO oxidation as a test reaction to compare the catalysed particulate filter and the conventional flow-through monolith with respect to their dynamic cold-start behaviour. Despite the fact that the two reactor configurations are tested with identical wash-coat formulation, precious metal loading and thermal mass, experiments show a significantly delayed cold-start for the particulate filter. The resulting cumulated CO emissions of the catalysed filter exceed those of the open monolith by -% in the temperature range between  degrees C and  degrees C. The experimental results are analysed by means of numerical simulation. In a first step a kinetic model of the CO oxidation is parameterised using only experimental data obtained for the conventional flow-through catalyst. The resulting kinetics are implemented in a model of the wall-flow filter. Without further modification of the kinetic parameters, this model quantitatively predicts the cold-start behaviour of the catalysed filter. Finally, the numerical model is used in a sensitivity analysis to identify and quantify the individual physical effects contributing to the experimentally observed difference in the light-off behaviour. It is shown that a part of the observed difference in the cold-start performance can be traced back to differences in cell density and the heat capacity of the plugs. Even at identical cell density and without the plug effect the filter shows significantly higher CO emissions. It is shown that this intrinsic difference between the filter and the conventional monolith can be quantitatively explained by differences in heat transfer, internal mass transfer and external mass transfer.", (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Non-shape DSA problems are considered for the dynamic crack propagation including the successive branching of cracks. The adjoint variable method is generally suitable for path-independent problems but employed in this bond-based peridynamics since its path is readily available. Since both original and adjoint systems possess time-reversal symmetry, the trajectories of systems are symmetric about the u-axis. We take advantage of the time-reversal symmetry for the efficient and concurrent computation of original and adjoint systems. Also, to improve the numerical efficiency of large scale problems, a parallel computation scheme is employed using a binary space decomposition method. The accuracy of analytical design sensitivity is verified by comparing it with the finite difference one. The finite difference method is susceptible to the amount of design perturbations and could result in inaccurate design sensitivity for highly nonlinear peridynamics problems with respect to the design.

This study was undertaken to investigate the environmental impact of land-use management on field-CO emissions in Ohakea silt loam soil (Typic andoaqualf) that had been converted from permanent pasture to forage cropping for  years. The treatments were plow tillage (PT) and no-tillage (NT), with summer fodder maize (Zea mays L.) double-cropped in rotation with winter oat (Avena sativa L.); permanent pasture (PP) was used as control. Field-CO emissions measured every - weeks during  months, were significantly highest in the PP. Overall, results indicate that reduction in tillage had only a minor effect on field-CO emission throughout the crop growth period, During one year CO emissions ranged from - kg C ha(-) per day in the PP treatment. - kg C ha(-) per day in the NT treatment and - kg C ha(-) per day in the PT treatment. Daily field-CO emissions measured within a few days after cultivation were significantly highest in the PP treatment and were in the order of PP > NT > PT.

Understanding groundwater flows to these ecologically sensitive bodies is important for coastal environmental sustainability. A management-oriented mathematical model capable of simulating the flow of groundwater into a coastal bay (i.e., submarine groundwater discharge) is developed here using the principles of quasi-steady-state flow and the existence of a sharp interface between the freshwater and the saltwater portions of the aquifer. The model is applied to the Baffin Bay in South Texas, a hypersaline coastal body with no major river discharges. Two global sensitivity approaches (the one-at-a time design; OAT) and the grid-based Monte Carlo sensitivity index are used to identify critical model inputs. The sensitivity of the model inputs to the Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) criterion is calculated making use of synoptic observed SGD measurements made over a period of one tidal cycle. The results of the study indicate that global sensitivity analysis methods are particularly sensitive to the number of model realizations. The ability of these techniques to screen out insensitive model inputs increased with increasing number of realizations. The variability in the identified inputs was more prominent with the OAT sensitivity methods than Monte Carlo-based techniques. In general, the aquifer properties (hydraulic conductivity and aquifer thickness) as well as fluid properties (seawater and fresh water densities) along with the antecedent SGD was noted to be the most sensitive parameters. This result indicates that the implementation of sharp-front coastal-aquifer models can be improved through better hydrogeologic characterization and measuring temperature and salinity data to improve density estimation. The global sensitivity methods also help identify reasonable values for model inputs which can serve as a starting point for advanced calibrations. The results, however, indicated that the model is likely over-parameterized with different input sets yielding similar NSE estimates. Based on these initial parameter estimates, the model was able to capture the general trend in the observed SGD but could not capture the dynamic associated with high water levels in the bay. Pre-calibration global sensitivity analysis is recommended in similar applications as it not only provides insights into future data collection efforts but can also help assess the likely success of model calibration. However, given the variability among the techniques, it is suggested that multiple global sensitivity methods be utilized.",,"Uddameri, V|Hernandez, EA|Singaraju, S",ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES,submarine groundwater discharges saltwater wedge profile global sensitivity parameter identification baffin bay texas,10.1007/s12665-013-2898-6

TOUR BOATS CONSERVATION PREDATORS,"This study examined the activities of ""northern resident"" killer whales (Orcinus orca) in Johnstone Strait, British Columbia, Canada, in July and August, from  to . Disturbance from boat traffic has been identified as a conservation concern for this population. The primary aims of the study were to test whether boat presence altered whales' activities, and if so, to estimate whether behavioural responses were likely to have carried energetic costs. A land-based observation site near a vessel-exclusion marine protected area allowed us to conduct a natural experiment to monitor whale activities in the presence and absence of boats. Using Time-Discrete Markov Chain models, boat presence was linked to significant changes in the probability that focal whales would switch from one activity state to another, which led to significantly different activity budgets in the presence and absence of boats. We estimated that the energetic cost of meeting these budgets differed by only -%. In the presence of boats, however, whales reduced their time spent feeding and the time spent rubbing their bodies on smooth pebble beaches. These lost feeding opportunities could have resulted in a substantial (%) estimated decrease in energy intake. Our sensitivity analysis provides preliminary evidence that disturbance could carry higher costs to killer whales in terms of reducing energy acquisition than increasing energetic demand, and future research should address this directly. Meanwhile, our observations suggest that protected areas would confer greatest conservation benefit to endangered killer whale populations if they were designed to protect important foraging areas.

In assessing nutrient effects on crop production, a crop-specific yield function was estimated. The linear and quadratic nitrogen (N) fertilizer terms were found to have correct signs, with a positive linear relationship, and were significant for major crops grown in the South Tobacco Creek (STC) Watershed. Crop response to phosphorus (P) occurred only for wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Nutrient application rates within the STC Watershed were generally within provincial recommended rates; however, data shows an increasing trend in the application of N in wheat, canola (Brassica napus L.), barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), and oat (Avena sativa L.) production over course of the study Nutrient export parameters at the field scale ( to  ha [ to  ac]), subwatershed scale ( ha [ ac]), and watershed scale (, ha [, ac]) were compared to production inputs. At the field scale, in a paired watershed study, N exported was not significantly related to the N applied. The relationships between P exported and P applied and conservation tillage management practices were statistically significant. At a larger subwatershed, the export of P from the subwatershed was significantly influenced by the volume of flow of water runoff and previous year P application. The export of N was only influenced by volume of flow but not by N application. For the STC Watershed, applied N did not affect N export. Assessment of P export found that the conversion to conservation tillage practices increased the P export. The opportunity value of the lost nutrients for the  ha ( ac) subwatershed averaged about C$. ha(-) y(-) (C$. ac(-) yr(-)), while on the paired subwatershed, the average loss was C$. ha(-) y(-) (C$. ac(-) yr(-)) on a conventionally managed field and C$. ha(-) y(-) (C$. ac(-) yr(-)) on a field under reduced tillage. For the entire STC Watershed, the export of nutrients represented a loss of opportunity of C$. ha(-) y(-) (C$. ac(-) yr(-)) or about % of annual fertilizer cost. Assessment of STC manure-applied data on an annual basis shows that the hauling and application of hog manure from  to  was generally more expensive than the nutrient value of the manure; however, in recent years, due to the increase in the value of commercial nutrients, the nutrient value of hog manure exceeds the cost.",,"Khakbazan, M|Hamilton, C|Elliott, J|Yarotski, J",JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION,cost nutrient export nutrient management watershed yield,10.2489/jswc.68.4.257

As a novelty we derive Duffy regularization transforms of the boundary element integrals for the axisymmetric case, which are then evaluated using a tensor-product Gaussian quadrature. Nonlinear ferromagnetic behaviour is resolved by Newton iterations. The optimization method under both linear and nonlinear constraints relies on the active-set steepest-descent search, projections onto the set of linearized constraints, and an adjoint method of shape sensitivity analysis.

To this end, four methods which can identify the relative contribution and/or the contribution profile of the input variables in neural networks describing the habitat preferences of this species were compared: (i) the 'PaD' ('Partial Derivatives') method consists of a calculation of the partial derivatives of the output in relation to the input variables; (ii) the 'Weights' method is a computation using the connection weights of the backpropagation Artificial Neural Networks; (iii) the 'Perturb' method analyses the effect of a perturbation of the input variables on the output variable; (iv) the 'Profile' method is a successive variation of one input variable while the others are kept constant at a fixed set of values. The dataset consisted of  samples, collected over a three-year period in the Zwalm river basin in Flanders, Belgium. Twenty-four environmental variables as well as the log-transformed abundance of Gammarus pulex were used in this study. The different contribution methods gave similar results concerning the order of importance of the input variables. Moreover, the stability of the methods was confirmed by gradually removing variables. Only in a limited number of cases a shift in the relative importance of the remaining input variables could be observed. Nevertheless, differences in sensitivity and stability of the methods were detected, probably as a result of the different calculation procedures. In this respect, the 'PaD' method made a more severe discrimination between minor and major contributing environmental variables in comparison to the 'Weights', 'Profile' and 'Perturb' methods.

The influence of model parameters on four model-predicted variables (model output) and the contributions of each of the model-predicted variables to the total variations in model output are presented.

The fraction of variance resulting from model parameter uncertainty was calculated by two methods and used for evaluation and ranking of the most influential model parameters. Nine out of the top  parameters identified by each method agreed, but their ranks were different. Spatial and temporal changes of model uncertainty were investigated and visualized. Model uncertainty appeared to be concentrated around specific water depths and dates that corresponded to significant storm events. The results suggest that spatial and temporal variations in the predicted water quality variables are sensitive to the hydrodynamics of physical perturbations such as those caused by stream inflows generated by storm events.

It has been numerically observed in the literature that the biased FD and RPD methods tend to have lower variance than the unbiased GT method and that centering the GT method (CGT) reduces its variance. We provide a theoretical justification for these observations in terms of system size asymptotic analysis under what is known as the classical scaling. Our analysis applies to GT, CGT, and FD and shows that the standard deviations of their estimators when normalized by the actual sensitivity scale as O(N-/), O(), and O(N-/), respectively, as system size N ->infinity. In the case of the FD methods, the N ->infinity asymptotics are obtained keeping the finite difference perturbation h fixed. Our numerical examples verify that our order estimates are sharp and that the variance of the RPD method scales similarly to the FD methods. We combine our large N asymptotics with previously known small h asymptotics to obtain the best choice of h in terms of N and estimate the number N-s of simulations required to achieve a prescribed relative L- error delta.

Cover crops grown between maturity and planting of these crops are one approach for reducing losses of NO. In this experiment, we evaluated the effectiveness of oat (Avena sativa L.) and rye (Secale cereale L.) cover crops in reducing NO concentrations and loads in subsurface drainage water. The oat fall cover crop was broadcast seeded into living corn and soybean crops before harvest in late August or early September and was killed by cold temperatures in late November or early December The rye winter cover crop, which had already been used annually for four years, was planted with a grain drill after corn and soybean harvest, overwintered, grew again in the spring, and was killed with herbicides before main crop planting. These treatments were evaluated in subsurface-drained field plots with an automated system for measuring drainage flow and collecting proportional samples for analysis of NO concentrations from each plot. The rye winter cover crop significantly reduced drainage water NO concentrations by % over five years, but this was less than the % reduction observed in its first four years of use. The oat fall cover crop reduced NO concentrations by % or about half of the reduction of the rye cover crop.

The main idea behind STEPS is to quantify the forecast uncertainty by adding stochastic perturbations to the deterministic Lagrangian extrapolation of radar images. The stochastic perturbations are designed to account for the unpredictable precipitation growth and decay processes and to reproduce the dynamic scaling of precipitation fields, i.e., the observation that large-scale rainfall structures are more persistent and predictable than small-scale convective cells. This paper presents the development, adaptation and verification of the STEPS system for Belgium (STEPS-BE). STEPS-BE provides in real-time -member ensemble precipitation nowcasts at  km and  min resolutions up to  h lead time using a  C-band radar composite as input. In the context of the PLURISK project, STEPS forecasts were generated to be used as input in sewer system hydraulic models for nowcasting urban inundations in the cities of Ghent and Leuven. Comprehensive forecast verification was performed in order to detect systematic biases over the given urban areas and to analyze the reliability of probabilistic forecasts for a set of case studies in  and . The forecast biases over the cities of Leuven and Ghent were found to be small, which is encouraging for future integration of STEPS nowcasts into the hydraulic models.

The method is based on linking formal direct sensitivity analysis of three-dimensional air quality models with an inverse modeling technique such that observational data of multiple species can be used to suggest improvements in emission strengths, patterns, and compositions of various source categories simultaneously. Information regarding the characteristics of the data and the emissions is incorporated into the model by means of weighting factors. A penalty function allows determining if the method is fully observation-driven, emission-driven, Dr mixed. The assimilation of the data requires an iterative process since the sensitivity coefficients change as emissions are adjusted, though results suggest that only three or four iterations are necessary. The method has been applied to the Atlanta Metro Area and tested with pseudo-observations. Perturbed emissions were adjusted close to their known original value in these test scenarios. When noisy pseudo-observations were used, the final simulated concentration errors were of the order of the noise applied to the pseudo-observations.",,"Mendoza-Dominguez, A|Russell, AG",ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY,,10.1021/es991040+

The nonlinear system of equations is solved by Newton's method. The catalytic partial oxidation of methane over rhodium catalyst in a coated honeycomb reactor is studied three-dimensionally, and eight gas-phase species (CH, CO, HO, N-, O-, CO, OH and H-) are considered for the simulation. Surface chemistry is modeled by detailed reaction mechanism including  heterogeneous reactions with  surface-adsorbed species for the Rh catalyst. The numerical results are compared with experimental data and good agreement is observed. Effects of the design variables, which include the inlet velocity, methane/oxygen ratio, catalytic wall temperature, and catalyst loading on the cost functions representing methane conversion and hydrogen production, are numerically investigated. The sensitivity analysis for the reactor is performed using three different approaches: finite difference, direct differentiation and an adjoint method.

The oat genotypes UFRGS and UPFAl-- have been developed through different breeding programs and are classified as Al-tolerant. Genetic analysis indicated that the Al tolerance in each genotype is conferred by one gene. Pyramiding Al tolerance genes may increase the tolerance level. The objectives of this study were to determine whether the AI-tolerance observed in both genotypes is conferred by different genes and to investigate the tolerance mechanisms. The aluminum tolerance of the F- population derived from the UFRGS X UPFAl-- cross was estimated by using the regrowth of the primary root, and the tolerance was compared to the parental frequency distribution. The tolerance mechanism was investigated in seedlings after Al exposure for seven days. Al accumulation in the root apex was visualized, and the activity of antioxidant enzymes, the content of non-protein thiol groups and the concentrations of ascorbic acid, superoxide and HO in the root apex, the differentiated root region and the shoots were measured. Al tolerance in UFRGS and UPFAl-- is conferred by the same gene. A diverse pattern of Al accumulation was obtained for the genotypes, suggesting that the external detoxification is not the main mechanism of tolerance. The tolerant genotypes were able to manage the oxidative stress caused by Al on the other hand the sensitive genotype showed higher oxidative stress and lipid oxidation. The relative importance of each antioxidant component could not be established because different responses were observed between the Al-tolerant genotypes. It is possible that the Al-tolerance gene codifies an upstream component, such as a transcription factor, which once induced by Al, ends up activating, among other pathways, the antioxidative system.", (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

In addition, an enormously large solution domain is required for numerical solution of this FPE (e.g. encompassing the entire orbit in the subspace), of which the state probability density function (pdf) occupies a tiny fraction at any given time. This coupling of large size, high dimensionality and nonlinearity makes for a formidable computational task, and has caused the FPE for orbital uncertainty propagation to remain an unsolved problem. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this paper presents the first successful direct solution of the FPE for perturbed Keplerian mechanics. To tackle the dimensionality issue, the time-varying state pdf is approximated in the CANDECOMP/PARAFAC decomposition tensor form where all the six spatial dimensions as well as the time dimension are separated from one other. The pdf approximation for all times is obtained simultaneously via the alternating least squares algorithm. Chebyshev spectral differentiation is employed for discretization on account of its spectral (""super-fast"") convergence rate. To facilitate the tensor decomposition and control the solution domain size, system dynamics is expressed using spherical coordinates in a noninertial reference frame.

However, it is still challenging to incorporate overall receptor flexibility, especially backbone flexibility, in docking due to the large conformational space that needs to be sampled. To overcome this problem, we developed a novel flexible docking approach, BP-Dock (Backbone Perturbation-Dock) that can integrate both backbone and side chain conformational changes induced by ligand binding through a multi-scale approach. In the BP-Dock method, we mimic the nature of binding-induced events as a first-order approximation by perturbing the residues along the protein chain with a small Brownian kick one at a time. The response fluctuation profile of the chain upon these perturbations is computed using the perturbation response scanning method. These response fluctuation profiles are then used to generate binding-induced multiple receptor conformations for ensemble docking. To evaluate the performance of BP-Dock, we applied our approach on a large and diverse data set using unbound structures as receptors. We also compared the BP-Dock results with bound and unbound docking, where overall receptor flexibility was not taken into account. Our results highlight the importance of modeling backbone flexibility in docking for recapitulating the experimental binding affinities, especially when an unbound structure is used. With BP-Dock, we can generate a wide range of binding site conformations realized in nature even in the absence of a ligand that can help us to improve the accuracy of unbound docking. We expect that our fast and efficient flexible docking approach may further aid in our understanding of protein ligand interactions as well as virtual screening of novel targets for rational drug design.",,"Bolia, A|Gerek, ZN|Ozkan, SB",JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL INFORMATION AND MODELING,,10.1021/ci4004927

For forest canopies, however, the relationship between the spectral response and leaf chemistry is confounded by factors such as background (e.g. understory), canopy structure, and the presence of non-photosynthetic vegetation (NPV, e.g. woody elements)-particularly the appreciable amounts of standing and fallen dead wood found in older forests. We present a sensitivity analysis for the estimation of chlorophyll content in woody coniferous canopies using radiative transfer modeling, and use the modeled top-of-canopy reflectance data to analyze the contribution of woody elements, leaf area index (LAI), and crown cover (CC) to the retrieval of foliar Cab content. The radiative transfer model used comprises two linked submodels: one at leaf level (PROSPECT) and one at canopy level (FLIGHT). This generated bidirectional reflectance data according to the band settings of the Compact High Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (CHRIS) from which chlorophyll indices were calculated. Most of the chlorophyll indices outperformed single wavelengths in predicting Cab content at canopy level, with best results obtained by the Maccioni index ([R() - R()]/[R() - R()]). We demonstrate the performance of this index with respect to structural information on three distinct coniferous forest types (young, early mature and old-growth stands). The modeling results suggest that the spectral variation due to variation in canopy chlorophyll content is best captured for stands with medium dense canopies. However, the strength of the up-scaled Cab signal weakens with increasing crown NPV scattering elements, especially when crown cover exceeds %. LAI exerts the least perturbations. We conclude that the spectral influence of woody elements is an important variable that should be considered in radiative transfer approaches when retrieving foliar pigment estimates in heterogeneous stands, particularly if the stands are partly defoliated or long-lived.", (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Analysis was performed on  data sets from four Water Survey of Canada gauging stations in order to evaluate the relative contribution of a range of error sources to the total estimated uncertainty. The factors that differed among data sets included the fraction of unmeasured discharge relative to the total discharge, flow nonuniformity, and operator decisions about instrument programming and measurement cross section. As anticipated, it was found that the estimated uncertainty is dominated by uncertainty of the discharge in the unmeasured areas, highlighting the importance of appropriate selection of the site, the instrument, and the user inputs required to estimate the unmeasured discharge. The main contributor to uncertainty was invalid data, but spatial inhomogeneity in water velocity and bottom-track velocity also contributed, as did variation in the edge velocity, uncertainty in the edge distances, edge coefficients, and the top and bottom extrapolation methods. To a lesser extent, spatial inhomogeneity in the bottom depth also contributed to the total uncertainty, as did uncertainty in the ADCP draft at shallow sites. The estimated uncertainties from QUant can be used to assess the adequacy of standard operating procedures. They also provide quantitative feedback to the ADCP operators about the quality of their measurements, indicating which parameters are contributing most to uncertainty, and perhaps even highlighting ways in which uncertainty can be reduced. Additionally, QUant can be used to account for self-dependent error sources such as heading errors, which are a function of heading. The results demonstrate the importance of a Monte Carlo method tool such as QUant for quantifying random and bias errors when evaluating the uncertainty of moving-boat ADCP measurements.",,"Moore, SA|Jamieson, EC|Rainville, F|Rennie, CD|Mueller, DS",JOURNAL OF HYDRAULIC ENGINEERING,moving-boat acoustic doppler current profiler (adcp) uncertainty monte carlo probabilistic stream gauging procedures,10.1061/(ASCE)HY.1943-7900.0001249

The goal is to study the sensitivity of acroacoustic noise radiated by this flow to various local perturbations of mass and energy, which is the first step to possible optimal control applications. The adjoint field shows the forcings that can be applied in order to achieve a given effect. Two test cases are presented. The first sensitivity analysis is based on a localized sinusoidal source in the dual space, corresponding to a localized sinusoidal source in the real space. The second one obtained from optimal control theory allows any frequency signature of the forcing. The adjoint perturbation, once it has reached the shear layer, propagates upstream until the inflow.

A risk assessment is then conducted to systematically compute the probability of exceeding a predetermined water quality standard. Numerical investigations reveal that the overall uncertainty of the output DO concentrations does not necessarily equal the sum of the uncertainties of all individual variables or parameters of interest. Therefore, different sources of uncertainty can have compensative or additive effects on the overall uncertainty of output DO concentrations. In a particular case study of the Buffalo River, the variability of measured concentrations was demonstrated to have the largest influence on the overall uncertainty of predicted DO concentrations. Notably, data with a higher collection frequency should have a smaller uncertainty, and therefore a smaller variability in the expected values, and so contribute less to the magnitude of the standard deviation of the output DO concentrations.

Digital image analysis provides a reliable and robust alternative to accurately calculate many biological features. This study presents and evaluates the performance of four open-source image-analysis programs i.e. ImageJ, CellProfiler, P-TRAP and SmartGrain to count crop seeds from digital images captured by camera and scanner. It also evaluates ImageJ program for automated seed counting using macro containing RenyiEntropy threshold algorithm. Digital images of cereal crop seeds were acquired i.e. wheat, barley, maize, rye, oat, sorghum, triticale and rice. All images contained  seeds per image present in an area of approx.  cm(). RenyiEntropy threshold increased the seed count accuracy of ImageJ from digital camera images. Generally, seed counts from digital camera images of all crops were accurate, but software-crop combination had significant (p < .) difference from reference value. Among image analysis programs, ImageJ produced mostly higher seed count across all observed crops than other programs. Mean seed counts from scanned images of maize were observed only by CellProfiler and P-TRAP, with other programs inappropriate due to high inaccuracy. These results suggest CellProfiler as a reliable image analysis program for seed counting from digital images. Benchmark test was also performed to compare speed of analysis. The automated seed count produced by image analysis programs described here allows faster, reliable and reproducible analysis, compared to standard manual method.

Thus, groundwater pollution becomes a major issue due to the increasing contamination, which poses serious and harmful risk to the environment. Groundwater vulnerability maps can be used as a tool to help decision makers to protect groundwater resources from contamination.

We addressed the biogeochemical impacts of land-use change in fully replicated black spruce forests and agricultural fields of different ages (following deforestation) and under different management regimes in interior Alaska. Change from forests to cultivated fields increased summer temperatures in surface soil layers by - degreesC, and lengthened the season of biological activity by two to three weeks. Decomposition of a common substrate (oat stubble) was enhanced by % in fields compared to forests after litter bags were buried for one year. In-situ net N mineralization rates in site-specific soil were similar in forests and fields during summer, but during winter, forests were the only sites where net N immobilization occurred. Field age and management had a significant impact on C and N mineralization. Rates of annual decomposition, soil respiration and summer net N mineralization tended to be lower in young than in old fields and higher in fallow than in planted young fields. To identify the major environmental factors controlling C and N mineralization, soil temperature, moisture and N availability were studied. Decomposition and net N mineralization seemed to be mainly driven by availability of inorganic N. Soil temperature played a role only when comparing forests and fields, but not in field-to-field differences. Results from soil respiration measurements in fields confirmed low sensitivity of heterotrophic respiration, and thus decomposition to temperature. In addition, both soil respiration and net N mineralization were limited by low soil water contents. Our study showed that () C and N mineralization are enhanced by forest clearing in subarctic soils, and () N availability is more important than soil temperature in controling C and N mineralization following forest clearing.

Standard analysis assumes that missingness is ignorable. Because the assumption can be questionable, the sensitivity of inferences to alternative assumptions about missingness needs to be evaluated. This need arises in the analysis of a longitudinal prostate cancer quality-of-life (QoL) clinical trial dataset, in which nonmonotone missingness occurs. The choice of the missing data model is studied in the analysis. A local sensitivity analysis method is then applied to analyze the dataset and to investigate the changes in parameter estimates in the neighborhood of the ignorable model. One advantage of the method is that it surmounts computational difficulty and completely avoids evaluating the high-dimensional integrals in the likelihood due to nonmonotone missingness. Another is that it can be implemented using the standard software without excessive additional computation. The method is especially advantageous for large clinical datasets for which alternative approaches can become computationally prohibitive. In addition, the analysis demonstrates the importance of exploiting information on reasons for missingness. When such information is unavailable for some missingness and therefore the missingness types (i.e., dropout versus intermittent missingness) are unknown, a bound analysis is proposed, combined with genetic algorithms, to account for unknown missingness types.

The latter is an important consideration when uncertainty analyses using the Monte Carlo techniques are to complement the modelling exercises. This paper describes the development of a quasi--D modeling approach, which still calculates the dynamic wave in -D but the discretisation of the computational units are in -D, allowing a better spatial representation of the flow in polders and avoiding large additional expenditure on data pre-processing and computational time. The model DYNHYD (-D hydrodynamics) from the WASP modeling package was used as a basis for the simulations and extended to incorporate the quasi--D approach. A local sensitivity analysis shows the sensitivity of parameters and boundary conditions on the filling volume of polders and capping of the peak discharge in the main river system. Two flood events on the Elbe River, Germany were used to calibrate and test the model. The results show a good capping effect on the flood peak by the proposed systems.

Discrete sensitivity analysis estimates these derivatives by taking advantage of additional derivative information available in an implicit computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solver of the discretized governing partial differential equations. The key benefits of steady-state discrete sensitivity analysis are its computational efficiency and numerical accuracy. More recently, the complex Taylor's series expansion (CTSE) method has been used to generate these design space derivatives to machine accuracy, by analyzing a complex perturbation of the objective function. For FORTRAN codes, this method is quite easy to implement, for both implicit and explicit codes; unfortunately, the CTSE method can be quite time consuming, because it requires a complex solution of the governing partial differential equations. In this paper, the authors demonstrate that the direct formulation of discrete, sensitivity analysis and the CTSE method solve the same iterative sensitivity equation, which sheds light on the most efficient use of the CTSE method.

Recently, a physics-based nonparametric approach for quantifying model-form uncertainty in RANS simulations has been proposed, where Reynolds stresses are projected to physically meaningful dimensions and perturbations are introduced only in the physically realizable limits (Xiao et al., ). However, a challenge associated with this approach is to assess the amount of information introduced in the prior distribution and to avoid imposing unwarranted constraints. In this work we propose a random matrix approach for quantifying model-form uncertainties in RANS simulations with the realizability of the Reynolds stress guaranteed, which is achieved by construction from the Cholesky factorization of the normalized Reynolds stress tensor. Furthermore, the maximum entropy principle is used to identify the probability distribution that satisfies the constraints from available information but without introducing artificial constraints. We demonstrate that the proposed approach is able to ensure the realizability of the Reynolds stress, albeit in a different manner from the physics-based approach. Monte Carlo sampling of the obtained probability distribution is achieved by using polynomial chaos expansion to map independent Gaussian random fields to the Reynolds stress random field with the marginal distributions and correlation structures as specified. Numerical simulations on a typical flow with separation have shown physically reasonable results, which verify the proposed approach. Therefore, the proposed method is a promising alternative to the physics-based approach for model-form uncertainty quantification of RANS simulations.

The toolbox was developed for application in the highland regions of northern Thailand. It incorporates the IHACRES rainfall-runoff model, a crop model (CATCHCROP), and an erosion model (a Universal Soil Loss Equation [USLE], modified for application to northern Thailand). In developing the individual models in the Biophysical Toolbox, emphasis was placed on limiting model complexity. The toolbox was developed and tested using data from the Mae Chaem catchment in northern Thailand. Due to the short duration and sparse distribution of the available data, the complexity of the model structure is constrained to consider only the key processes of interest. Despite the relative simplicity of the individual models, linkages between the models encompassed in the Biophysical Toolbox increase the complexity of the modelling system. This paper explores sensitivities in the Biophysical Toolbox to the parameters of CATCHCROP as this component has the greatest potential for propagating errors though the Toolbox. A simple sensitivity analysis was undertaken, whereby parameter values were perturbed to ascertain the effect of these perturbations on output indicators. The hydrologic component showed strong non-linearity to the infiltration parameters of the CATCHCROP model, although this did not greatly impact estimates of total annual discharge. Additionally, a number of CATCHCROP parameters did not greatly impact some output indicators of the toolbox. While the CATCHCROP model is relatively parsimonious when compared with many crop models, there are still  model parameters that must be determined from the field or prescribed from the literature. There is potential for the model to be further simplified although more extensive model testing is required to ensure that such simplifications would not adversely impact on the utility of the toolbox.

Another area of improving the solution quality of metaheuristics is finding the optimal combination of algorithm control parameters.

Referring to the statistical analysis it is observed that none of the interactions between the Ant System parameters has a significant effect on makespan value.

This simplification occasionally leads to problems when the mean value of the input variable is close to a local or global maximum or minimum value of the function. In this case, the FOSM computes artificially a zero uncertainty because the first derivative of the function is equal to zero.

First, MCF- cells were exposed to a number of chemical carcinogens, that is, benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P), -OH-B[a]P, -OH-B[a]P, -OH-B[a]P, B[a]P-trans-,-dihydrodiol, -nitropyrene, -nitrochrysene, dibenzo[a,l]pyrene, benzo[c]phenanthrene, dibenzo[a,h]anthracene, -methylcholanthrene, and -amino--methyl--phenylimidazo[,-b]pyridine. Spot I was detected as a minor adduct in cells treated with B[a]P but not other compounds. Second, to determine whether Spot  is derived from lipid peroxidation products or estrogen metabolites, it was compared with adduct profiles of cells or DNAs exposed to beta-estradiol, -hydroxy estradiol, ,hydroxynonenal, or oxidized oat oil. Spot I was not detectable in these samples. In addition, Spot I did not comigrate, with the ,N--ethenodeoxyguanosine adduct standard. Third, to explore the mechanism of Spot  formation, it was compared with adduct profiles detected in DNA or mononucleotides reacted with BPDE, -OH-,-dihydrodiol of B[a]P, and -OH-,-dihydrodiol of B[a]P as well as in rats orally treated with B[a]P. Spot  comigrated with a minor adduct in BPDE-treated DNA during anion exchange rechromatography but these two adducts were separated by partition chromatography. Spot  also behaved in a manner that was very similar to that of the polar B[a]P adducts detected in rat liver, but the two adducts were separated by HPLC. Fourth, Spot  was compared with CD mice exposed to H-benzo[c]fluorene (B[c]F). Spot  from some patients comigrated with a major adduct induced by [c]F. Finally, we found that the presence of Spot I in human breast tissues was not related to smoking status but, rather, with CYPA Mspl polymorphism. The CYPA mutant carriers had a significantly higher frequency of this adduct than did the wild-type genotypes. Furthermore, individuals with Spot  had a significantly higher staining intensity for BPDE-PAH adducts in their tissue sections than those without it.

However, these activities are not frequently integrated because there is a widespread perception that cattle have a negative effect on cropping, especially when high crop yields are a goal. This misunderstanding of the synergy between pastures, livestock and crops is linked to overgrazing at the pasture rotation phase, which causes a decline in soil quality. Few studies have investigated the effect of pasture grazing intensities on soil carbon (C) balance and soil quality in subtropical environments. This work assessed the effects of different grazing intensities (., ., . and . m sward height) on soil C indices and animal productivity in a clay Haplorthox. The crop-livestock system model was a soybean/ryegrass plus black oat annual rotation managed for  years, using a randomized complete block design with three replications. Grazing intensity affected the quantity and composition of soil C input. Under heavy grazing with limited soil C input, there was a decrease in pasture and an increase in soybean participation in total C input. Soil organic C (-. m) under different grazing intensities had a linear relationship with C stratification ratio, C management index (CMI) and C pool index.

In this framework, the sensitivities of the mean values and variances of the structural performance function with respect to the design variables are calculated for use in the optimization task. The robust design of structures is formulated as a multi-criteria optimization problem, in which both the expected value and the standard deviation of the objective function are to be minimized. The robustness of the feasibility is also taken into account by involving the variability of the Structural response in the constraints.

However, due to accelerated land use change and lack of understanding of the functions of wetland ecosystems, they have deteriorated, if not been lost in many areas worldwide. Meanwhile, current functional wetland assessment techniques only provide rough estimations, and are in most cases site specific and qualitative. The overall goal of this project is to examine the sediment reduction benefit of wetland implementation scenarios both at subbasin and watershed scales. Two sets of models were used to accomplish this goal. First, a watershed model - the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), was employed to estimate sediment load at the subbasin scale. However, due to limitations of wetland functions of SWAT, a second model - the System for Urban Stormwater Treatment and Analysis Integration (SUSTAIN) was used. The sediment load generated for each subbasin was incorporated in the SUSTAIN model. This allows for evaluating sediment reduction capability of wetlands at subbasin level. Next, a portion of sediment not treated by a wetland was fed back to the SWAT model and routed to the watershed outlet. The impacts of four different wetland surface areas (., ., , and  ha) on sediment load mitigation were examined one-at-a-time for all subbasins within the River Raisin watershed located in southeastern Michigan and northeastern Ohio. Comparison of the sediment reductions due to different wetland restoration scenarios reveals the importance of wetland placement in a watershed. In general, the rate of streamflow reduction resulting from wetland implementation is higher than sediment reduction at the subbasin level but more comparable at the watershed level. In addition, clusters of wetlands installed at the distance of - stream km from the outlet outperformed other clustered wetlands at closer and farther distances. Wetlands associated with st order streams performed better at the subbasin level, while wetlands located at th order streams performed better at the watershed level. Considering environmental and economic issues of wetland restoration scenarios revealed that the . ha wetlands were the most suitable for subbasin and watershed level implementation due to its sediment reduction efficiency and significantly lower cost of installation and maintenance.", (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Selenium content of tubewell waters at or near the toxic sites ranged between . and . mug l(-) with an average value of . mug l(-). The maximum contamination level (MCL) of  mug Se l(-) for drinking purposes was exceeded by .% of the tubewell waters and the maximum permissible level (MPL) of  mug Se l(-) for irrigation purposes was exceeded by .% of the waters.

Underground water pumped from shallow tubewells (- m depth) contained - times more Se than that from deep tubewells ( m depth). Selenium enrichment in the soil obtained by subtracting Se removed by crops from Se additions through irrigation water, was found to be highly positive in the case of rice and sunflower. Selenium balances turned out to be negative for mustard followed by Egyptian clover, pearl millet and wheat. In rice-based cropping sequences, Se balances were positive, suggesting that cultivation of rice may be discouraged if the aim is to reduce accumulation in shallow groundwater.

To quantify this uncertainty operational flood forecasting centers make use of rainfall forecasts obtained by ensemble predicting systems (EPS). The EPS forecasts are generated by perturbing the initial conditions of numerical weather prediction models. Question, however, remains whether these EPS cover the real forecast uncertainty range and whether the EPS-based uncertainty estimates are similar to the ones obtained by statistical methods. Both questions are addressed in this research based on data of a flood forecasting system in Belgium. Comparison is made between the uncertainty bounds generated by EPS and by a Monte Carlo-based statistical method after historical forecasted rainfall uncertainty analysis. The latter analysis calculates the error between forecasted and observed catchment rainfall, taking into account the dependency on lead time and rainfall depth. The forecasted rainfall errors are described by truncated normal distributions, which allow to calculate the full uncertainty distribution on a deterministic rainfall forecast. It is concluded that the EPS may underestimate the influence of the total forecasted rainfall uncertainty.

Accordingly, the reliability of the network systems in urban water management has a crucial role. The failure of a component in these systems impacts potable water distribution and urban drainage. Therefore, water distribution and urban drainage systems are categorized as critical infrastructure. Vulnerability is the degree to which a system is likely to experience harm induced by perturbation or stress. However, for risk assessment, we usually assume that events and failures are singular and independent, i.e. several simultaneous events and cascading events are unconsidered. Although failures can be causally linked, a simultaneous consideration in risk analysis is hardly considered. To close this gap, this work introduces the term cascade vulnerability for water infrastructure. Cascade vulnerability accounts for cascading and simultaneous events. Following this definition, cascade risk maps are a merger of hazard and cascade vulnerability maps. In this work cascade vulnerability maps for water distribution systems and urban drainage systems based on the 'Achilles-Approach' are introduced and discussed. It is shown, that neglecting cascading effects results in significant underestimation of risk scenarios.",,"Sitzenfrei, R|Mair, M|Moderl, M|Rauch, W",WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY,critical infrastructure gis hydraulic failure simulation risk assessment sensitivity analysis,10.2166/wst.2011.813

Using the data from  catchments in eastern Australia, the BGLS-ROI is constructed to regionalise the flood quantiles (Quantile Regression Technique (QRT)) and the first three moments of the log-Pearson type  (LP) distribution (Parameter Regression Technique (PRT)). This scheme firstly develops a fixed region model to select the best set of predictor variables for use in the subsequent regression analyses using an approach that minimises the model error variance while also satisfying a number of statistical selection criteria. The identified optimal regression equation is then used in the ROI experiment where the ROI is chosen for a site in question as the region that minimises the predictive uncertainty. To evaluate the overall performances of the quantiles estimated by the QRT and PRT, a one-at-a-time cross-validation procedure is applied. Results of the proposed method indicate that both the QRT and PRT in a BGLS-ROI framework lead to more accurate and reliable estimates of flood quantiles and moments of the LP distribution when compared to a fixed region approach. Also the BGLS-ROI can deal reasonably well with the heterogeneity in Australian catchments as evidenced by the regression diagnostics. Based on the evaluation statistics it was found that both BGLS-QRT and PRT-ROI perform similarly well, which suggests that the PRT is a viable alternative to QRT in RFFA. The RFFA methods developed in this paper is based on the database available in eastern Australia. It is expected that availability of a more comprehensive database (in terms of both quality and quantity) will further improve the predictive performance of both the fixed and ROI based RFFA methods presented in this study, which however needs to be investigated in future when such a database is available.", (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Various studies have unanimously cited the shortwave incoming radiation (R-S) to be the most robust reference variable explaining the ratio between ETd and ETi. This study aims to contribute in ETi upscaling for global studies using the ratio between daily and instantaneous incoming shortwave radiation (R-Sd/R-Si) as a factor for converting ETi to ETd. This paper proposes an artificial neural network (ANN) machine-learning algorithm first to predict R-Sd from R-Si followed by using the R-Sd / R-Si ratio to convert ETi to ETd across different terrestrial ecosystems. Using R-Si and R-Sd observations from multiple sub-networks of the FLUXNET database spread across different climates and biomes (to represent inputs that would typically be obtainable from remote sensors during the overpass time) in conjunction with some astronomical variables (e.g. solar zenith angle, day length, exoatmospheric shortwave radiation), we developed the ANN model for reproducing R-Sd and further used it to upscale ETi to ETd. The efficiency of the ANN is evaluated for different morning and afternoon times of day, under varying sky conditions, and also at different geographic locations. R-S-based upscaled ETd produced a significant linear relation (R- = . to .), low bias (-. to . MJ m(-) d(-); approx.  %), and good agreement (RMSE . to . MJ m(-) d(-); approx.  %) with the observed ETd, although a systematic overestimation of ETd was also noted under persistent cloudy sky conditions. Inclusion of soil moisture and rainfall information in ANN training reduced the systematic overestimation tendency in predominantly overcast days. An intercomparison with existing upscaling method at daily, -day, monthly, and yearly temporal resolution revealed a robust performance of the ANN-driven R-S-based ETi upscaling method and was found to produce lowest RMSE under cloudy conditions. Sensitivity analysis revealed variable sensitivity of the method to biome selection and high ETd prediction errors in forest ecosystems are primarily associated with greater rainfall and cloudiness. The overall methodology appears to be promising and has substantial potential for upscaling ETi to ETd for field and regional-scale evapotranspiration mapping studies using polar orbiting satellites.",,"Wandera, L|Mallick, K|Kiely, G|Roupsard, O|Peichl, M|Magliulo, V",HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES,,10.5194/hess-21-197-2017

The target variable is the prediction of Total Dry Matter (TDM) production in each of the three growth cycles. Two scenarios are employed to process the available remotely sensed LAI values, predicting TDM values when forcing in PILOTE either the initial and maximal optical LAI-values, or the initial, maximal and daily interpolated LAI values. The predictions show low deviations compared with the in situ TDM values (RMSE of . t/ha, MAPE of %). The feasibility of using harvest dates that are derived from optical data is examined by feeding the model with randomly perturbed harvest dates. The magnitude of the perturbations is equal to the revisit times of the current optical sensors. Optical images with revisit times lower than  days are adequate to feed PILOTE with remotely sensed harvest dates. Emphasis is placed on the forcing of ""uncertain"" irrigation dates, derived from Synthetic Aperture Radar images either replacing all true irrigation dates by randomly perturbed dates (using -day perturbation magnitudes) or hypothesizing one or several irrigations are ""missed"" (undetected). The results show negligible errors for the TDM predictions when noisy irrigation dates are used (RMSE of . t/ha and MAPE of .%). Disregarding one or two irrigations within a period with important rainfalls does not induce significant errors for the predicted TDM values; however, it causes noticeable underestimations in drier periods (maximum of . t/ha, reference TDM of . t/ha).

Especially for biofilm models, local sensitivity analysis is not very useful as parameters can vary over a large range. Parameters that were evaluated included kinetic and stoichiometric parameters, and also biofilm parameters, such as internal and external mass transfer, the biofilm thickness, and the biomass density. Global sensitivity analyses were performed for a range of operating conditions of a biofilm reactor. The results of the qualitative screening method of Morris were compared with the results of the quantitative variance-based method FAST regarding the input parameters indicated as unimportant. Both methods resulted in similar sets of parameters with a small influence on the model output, but the screening method of Morris required a much smaller number of model evaluations to compute the sensitivity measures than the FAST method.",,"Brockmann, D|Morgenroth, E",WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY,biofilm model global sensitivity analysis nitrification screening method variance-based method wastewater treatment,10.2166/wst.2007.600

Classically, this derivative comes from the second term of the topological asymptotic expansion, dealing only with infinitesimal perturbations. However, for practical applications, we need to insert perturbations of finite size. Therefore, we consider one more term in the expansion which is defined as the second order topological derivative. In order to present these ideas, in this work we calculate first as well as second order topological derivatives for the total potential energy associated to the Laplace's equation, when the domain is perturbed with a hole. Furthermore, we also study the effects of different boundary conditions on the hole: Neumann and Dirichlet (both homogeneous). In the Neumann's case, the second order topological derivative depends explicitly on higher-order gradients of the state solution and also implicitly on the point where the hole is nucleated through the solution of an auxiliary problem. On the other hand, in the Dirichlet's case, the first order topological derivative depends explicitly on the state solution as well as implicitly through the solution of an auxiliary problem, and the second order topological derivative depends only explicitly on the solution associated to the original problem. Finally, we present two simple examples showing the influence of both terms in the second order topological asymptotic expansion for each case of boundary condition on the hole.",,"de Faria, JR|Novotny, AA",STRUCTURAL AND MULTIDISCIPLINARY OPTIMIZATION,topological asymptotic expansion first order topological derivative second order topological derivative,10.1007/s00158-009-0436-7

The yield of the process may be limited by reaction equilibrium, product inhibition of the enzyme, low concentrations and possibly low reaction rates, while the recovery of the product may be limited due to thermodynamic constraints such as azeotropes. Using enzymes in an integrated reactive distillation process can overcome these limitations and provides a cost advantage over classic batch reactor processes. The aim of this paper is i) to report the successful pilot-scale experimental validation of an Enzymatic Reactive Distillation (ERD) process for the synthesis of butyl butyrate and ii) to establish a rate-based model for conceptual process design which can be quickly adapted to other systems. The main novelty is the application of a continuous RD column with enzymes as a heterogeneous catalyst provided in: two different types of catalytic packing: loosely filled immobilized enzyme beads in standard packings with catalyst pockets and gauze packings with catalytic coating. Experimental pilot-scale experiments show the feasibility of ERD and allow the comparison of the different packing types based on catalytic performance as well as stability. Furthermore, these experiments are used to validate a predictive rate-based model to describe ERD which can be used to check the sensitivity of process and design parameters as well as to provide a quick adaption to other systems for quick evaluation.", (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) has been considered as a useful tool to support environmental decision-making in agricultural systems. In this study, the quantification and identification of the environmental impacts derived from two different double cropping systems comprising winter and summer crops for silage production (forage sorghum, barley and oat) was performed following an attributional LCA perspective in accordance with ISO  standards. Primary data of cereal production for dairy cattle feeding were obtained from a representative year. Only secondary data were used for background processes. Four different functional units were considered to report the environmental profiles:  t dry matter silage (base case),  ha,  t crude protein and  MJ metabolisable energy. According to the results, the combination of sorghum with barley presented better environmental results than sorghum with oat when the impacts were reported for mass and energy based functional units, which is attributed to the biomass yield (% higher) achieved under similar agricultural practices. When the functional unit of  ha was taken, the scenario of sorghum and oat was more beneficial due to lower requirements of diesel and herbicides for the agricultural activities per cultivation area. Regardless the functional unit considered, both field preparation and biomass harvesting were the agricultural stages which reported the largest contributions to the environmental impacts (similar to %) due to on-field emissions associated to manure application, diesel use in agricultural machinery and seed production. If the crops are separately assessed, sorghum cultivation system would be the best option due to the highest biomass yield, followed by barley and oat considering  kg dry matter silage as functional unit. However, when  ha was considered to report the results, the barley system was the worst alternative due to the highest seed ratio and diesel requirements (high input-output system). Environmental results must be interpreted within limitation of assumptions accepted by LCA community. Variations on climate and soil parameters as well as nutrients uptake by crops should be analysed and required in further research in order to reduce uncertainties.", (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The data were acquired February , , using a SAAB TopEye laser profiling system, with a sampling density of approximately  returns per square meter. The sparse and complex configuration of the branches of the leaf-off forest provides sufficient returns to allow the detection of the trees as individual objects and to analyse their vertical structures. Initially, for the detection of the individual trees only, the lidar data are first inserted in a ) digital image, with the height as the pixel value or brightness level. The empty pixels are interpolated, and height outliers are removed. Gaussian smoothing at different scales is performed to create a three-dimensional scale-space structure. Blob signatures based on second-order image derivatives are calculated, and then normalised so they can be compared at different scale-levels. The grey-level blobs with the strongest normalised signatures are selected within the scale-space structure. The support regions of the blobs are marked one-at-a-time in the segmentation result image with higher priority for stronger blobs. The segmentation results of six individual hectare plots are assessed by a computerised, objective method that makes use of a ground reference data set of the individual tree crowns. For analysis of individual trees, a subset of the original laser returns is selected within each tree crown region of the canopy reference map. Indices based on moments of the first four orders, maximum value and number of canopy and ground returns, are estimated. The indices are derived separately for height and laser reflectance of branches for the two echoes. Significant differences (p < .) are detected for numerous indices for three major native species groups: oaks (Quercus spp.), red maple (Acer rubrum) and yellow poplar (Liriodendron tuliperifera). Tree species classification results of different indices suggest a moderate to high degree of accuracy using single or multiple variables.

We evaluated the effect of cereal grains and native perennial companion crops on biomass yield of three different bioenergy crop types (switchgrass (Panicum virgatum (L.) Vitman) monoculture, four-species native grass mixture, and CP- polyculture mixture) during the seeding year and two subsequent harvest years at four environments. Effects of companion crops on bioenergy crop yields were inconsistent across locations and time, but some general patterns were observed. Averaged across all bioenergy crops, three companion cropping treatments-oat (Avena sativa L.), barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), and Canada wildrye (Elymus canadensis L.) harvested for forage-produced harvestable biomass during the seeding year while suppressing weeds and maintaining perennial biomass yield of the main crop during the first harvest year. Harvestable forage yields were greater for the oat companion crop compared to Canada wildrye during the seeding year at two environments, which could make the cereal grain companion crops more profitable for producers, depending on biomass markets. The polyculture crop yielded  and  % more perennial biomass than the switchgrass and grass mix in one environment and had  % less weed biomass compared to switchgrass in another.

We discuss that perturbation scale is inherent to any (local and global) SA approach, and explain how derivative-based SA approaches (e.g., method of Morris) focus on small-scale perturbations, while variance-based approaches (e.g., method of Sobol) focus on large-scale perturbations. We employ a novel variogram-based approach, called Variogram Analysis of Response Surfaces (VARS), which bridges derivative-and variance-based approaches. Our analyses with different real-world environmental models demonstrate significant implications of subjectivity in the perturbation-scale choice and the need for strategies to address these implications. It is further shown how VARS can uniquely characterize the perturbation-scale dependency and generate sensitivity measures that encompass all sensitivity-related information across the full spectrum of perturbation scales.

Concerning quasi-symmetric or partial-symmetric structures that frequently appear, one of their primary features is closely-distributed natural frequencies. For structure with closely-spaced eigenvalues, due to its instability and sensitivity to the changes of design variables and its excessively concentrated adjacent eigenvalues, conventional uncertainty analysis or dynamic reanalysis methods for distinct eigenvalue are no longer available. Initially, the spectral decompositions of stiffness and mass matrices are provided; by transfer technique, the eigen-problem of closely-spaced eigenvalues is converted to that of repeated eigenvalues with two perturbation parts appended; then the perturbed closely-spaced eigenvalue is rewritten as the sum of original closely-spaced eigenvalues' mean value and surrogate model which approximates the first-order perturbation term by polynomial chaos expansions. According to this method, statistical quantities of perturbed closely-spaced eigenvalues are calculated directly and accurately, which contributes to its uncertainty analysis and dynamic reanalysis. Furthermore, the capability of proposed method in dealing with relatively large uncertainties and complex engineering structure is demonstrated.

The fate and transport of pathogens in water is a complex process controlled by various factors of hydrodynamics, hydrology, chemistry, and microbiology. To better understand the importance of these factors and their roles in the inactivation, transport, and removal of pathogens, it is extremely important to enhance the reliability and effectiveness of a model by increasing the accuracy of simulation and prediction. This paper reports the results of sensitivity analyses on each of these factors using a calibrated hydrodynamic model coupled with a water quality model for temperature variation and E. coli transport. A nearshore region in southern Lake Michigan was used as the modeling domain in this research. Based on the sensitivity analysis method of differential analyses coupled with one-at-a-time design, the results show that the sensitivity of the different parameters can be ranked in decreasing order as follows: solar insolation, temperature correction factor, dispersion coefficients, tributary loading, wind velocity, and settling velocity. More detailed investigation of sunlight-related parameters using Chapra's formula shows that t() is predominant over other factors on E. coli inactivation caused by insolation. The sensitivity of sunlight-related parameters can be ranked in decreasing order as follows: t(), theta(d), k(e), alpha, and theta(l).

Under the total Lagrangian formulation, large deformations considering the initial curvature of curved beams are described by geometrically exact beam theory (GEBT) and Jaumann strain formulation. In the isogeometric approach, the higher order continuity and the exact description of initial geometry are naturally embedded using NURBS basis functions. In multi-patch models, C--continuity of physical displacement or C--continuity of displacement component at junction is weakly imposed using the Lagrange multiplier method. The superior accuracy of isogeometric analysis (IGA) is verified through the comparison with the results of finite element analysis (FEA) using cubic Hermite interpolation. In the DSA, a material derivative is utilized and the kinematical description of GEBT is consistently employed to express orientation design variations. Contrary to the IGA-based DSA, the Hermite basis function explicitly depends on design in the FEA-based DSA due to its element length parameter. Moreover, since the design velocity field is approximated using the nodal velocity imposed at nodal tangential vector, the amount of design perturbations should be very small to obtain precise design sensitivity.", (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This is because simulation is safer, less expensive, and faster than field implementation and experimenting. To achieve high fidelity and credibility in conducting prediction and exploration of the actual system with simulation models, a rigorous calibration and validation procedure should firstly be applied. However, one of the key issues in calibration is the acquisition of valid source information from the target system. The aim of this study is to develop a systematic method to automatically calibrate a general emergency department model with incomplete data. The simulation-based optimization was used to search for the best value of model parameters. Then we present a case study to particularly demonstrate the way to calibrate an agent-based model of an emergency department with real data scarcity.

However, little attention has been given to placing human-caused perturbations affecting one or more life-history stages in the context of the overall population dynamics of particular species. We used two types of ecological sensitivity analysis to determine which vital rates have the strongest influence on the population dynamics of western toads ( Bufo boreas ), red-legged frogs ( Rana aurora ), and common frogs ( Rana temporaria ), pond-breeding amphibians that have declined in all or portions of their ranges. Our results suggest that post-metamorphic vital rates and highly variable vital rates both have a strong influence on the population dynamics of these species and therefore deserve more research and management attention. Ecological sensitivity analysis should be more widely applied to the issue of amphibian declines in order to identify the most plausible mechanisms of decline and prioritize which life-history stages should be the focus of research and management efforts. Future experimental studies of perturbations in one or more life-history stage should attempt to link the magnitude of the perturbation measured with the overall population-level consequences.

It is a renewable energy source that can be used in these engines without significant alteration in design. The detailed chemical kinetics of biodiesel is however highly complex. In the present study, a skeletal mechanism with  species and  reactions for a tri-component biodiesel surrogate, which consists of methyl decanoate, methyl -decanoate and n-heptane was developed for simulations of -D turbulent spray combustion under engine-like conditions. The reduction was based on an improved directed relation graph (DRG) method that is particularly suitable for mechanisms with many isomers, followed by isomer lumping and DRG-aided sensitivity analysis (DRGASA). The reduction was performed for pressures from  to  atm and equivalence ratios from . to  for both extinction and ignition applications. The initial temperatures for ignition were from  to  K. The wide parameter range ensures the applicability of the skeletal mechanism under engine-like conditions. As such the skeletal mechanism is applicable for ignition at both low and high temperatures. Compared with the detailed mechanism that consists of  species and  reactions, the skeletal mechanism features a significant reduction in size while still retaining good accuracy and comprehensiveness.

The first-order variations of the energy forms, load form and kinematic and structural responses with respect to configuration design variables are derived. For the configuration design, both the shape and orientation variations contribute to the first-order variation of the equations of motion. The angular design velocity field associated with Euler angles is used to represent the orientation variation to obtain accurate design sensitivity results. Like Part I of the paper, the updated Lagrangian formulation and direct differentiation method are used for DSA for the path-dependent problem. For the updated Lagrangian formulation, the design velocity held that defines the mapping between the initial and perturbed designs should also be updated at each configuration.

To investigate the degree of influence of these parameters on calculation of models of land subsidence and ground fissures, Morris' global sensitivity analysis, combined with local sensitivity analysis, was applied. The accuracy of soil parameter sensitivity analysis is related closely to selection of the calculation model used. Based on Biot's consolidation theory, and combined with the nonlinear rheological theory of soil, a three-dimensional full coupling mathematic model was established to simulate land subsidence and ground fissures, in which the constitutive relation in Biot's consolidation theory was extended to viscoelastic plasticity. The dynamic relationships of soil parameters (porosity, permeability coefficient, parameters of soil deformation) accompanied by changes in the stress field were also considered. Consequently, this model conforms to actual conditions in the field. Nantong, Jiangsu Province in China, was selected to simulate and calculate land subsidence and ground fissures using this model, and the soil parameters' sensitivities were analyzed. The results showed that elastic modulus, E, cohesion, c, and the specific weight of soil, lambda, have a significant influence on land subsidence and ground fissures, with the influence of the friction angle, phi, on land subsidence, and of Poisson's ratio, m, on ground fissures taking second place.

Efficient numerical simulation is required to quantify the effect of uncertainty in these control parameters in terms of the response of the clarifier thickener system. Thus, the problem at hand is one of uncertainty quantification for nonlinear hyperbolic problems with several random perturbations. The presented hybrid stochastic Galerkin method is devised so as to extend the polynomial chaos approximation by multiresolution discretization in the stochastic space.

Consequently, the key variables which affect the habitat preferences of Asellus could be identified.

Twenty-four environmental variables as well as the log-transformed abundance of Asellus were used in this study. The different contribution methods seemed to give similar results concerning the order of importance of the input variables. Nevertheless, their diverse computation led to differences in sensitivity and stability of the methods and the derived outcomes on the habitat preferences. From an ecological point of view, the environmental variables describing the stream type (width, depth, stream order and distance to mouth) were the most significant variables for Asellus in the Zwalm catchment during the period - for all applied methods.

Firstly, the bioluminescence (lux) gene was introduced into fluorescent Pseudomonas strains, and the colonization of on spinach roots by fluorescent Pseudomonas strains was observed using a CCD (charge-coupled device) camera. As a result, various organic materials were found to promote the colonization of spinach roots by fluorescent Pseudomonas strains. H- strain colonized the roots when oat straw and betaine monohydrate, rice husks, Japanese pampas grass and horse feces compost (with rice straw) were applied. D- strain colonized the roots when hippuric acid sodium salt, Japanese pampas grass, oat straw, horse feces compost (with rice straw) and trehalose dehydrate were applied.

The growth of spinach was promoted when fluorescent Pseudomonas strains and organic materials except for Japanese pampas grass were applied. Since the growth of spinach was not promoted when only the organic materials were applied, this growth-promoting effect was considered to be due to the fluorescent Pseudomonas strains that colonized the roots more readily when the organic materials were applied.

However, the load of food waste to the conventional waste treatment process might lead to the high concentration of total nitrogen (T-N) impact on the effluent water quality. The objective of this study is to establish two machine learning models-artificial neural networks (ANNs) and support vector machines (SVMs), in order to predict -day interval T-N concentration of effluent from a wastewater treatment plant in Ulsan, Korea. Daily water quality data and meteorological data were used and the performance of both models was evaluated in terms of the coefficient of determination (R-), Nash-Sutcliff efficiency (NSE), relative efficiency criteria (d(rel)). Additionally, Latin-Hypercube one-factor-at-a-time (LH-OAT) and a pattern search algorithm were applied to sensitivity analysis and model parameter optimization, respectively. Results showed that both models could be effectively applied to the -day interval prediction of T-N concentration of effluent.

This results in poorly identifiable or nonidentifiable model parameters. For small models, plots of sensitivity functions have proven to be useful for the analysis of parameter identifiability. For models with many parameters, however, near-linear dependence of sensitivity functions can no longer be assessed graphically. In this paper a systematic approach for tackling the parameter identifiability problem of large models based on local sensitivity analysis is presented. The calculation of two identifiability measures that are easy to handle and interpret is suggested. The first accounts for the sensitivity of model results to single parameters, and the second accounts for the degree of near-linear dependence of sensitivity functions of parameter subsets. It is shown how these measures provide identifiability diagnosis for parameter subsets, how they are able to guide the selection of identifiable parameter subsets for parameter estimation, and how they facilitate the interpretation of the correlation matrix of the parameter estimate with respect to parameter identifiability. In addition, we show how potential bias of the parameter estimates, due to a priori fixing of some of the parameters, can be analyzed.

The linear design sensitivity equation is solved at each converged load step without the need of iteration, which is quite efficient in computation.

Groundwater flow models are usually constructed at somewhat larger scales (involving a coarser discretization) to include natural boundary conditions. They are commonly calibrated using observed groundwater levels and flows (if available). The groundwater solute transport models may be constructed at a smaller scale with finer discretization than the flow models in order to accurately delineate the solute source and the modeled target, to capture any heterogeneity that may affect contaminant migration, and to minimize numerical dispersion while still maintaining a reasonable computing time. The solution that is explored here is based on defining a finer grid subdomain within a larger coarser domain. The local-grid refinement (LGR) implemented in the Modular D finite-difference ground-water flow model (MODFLOW) code has such a provision to simulate groundwater flow in two nested grids: a higher-resolution sub-grid within a coarse grid. Under the premise that the interface between both models was well defined, a comprehensive sensitivity and uncertainty analysis was performed whereby the effect of a parameter perturbation in a coarser-grid model on transport predictions using a higher-resolution grid was quantified. This approach was tested for a groundwater flow and solute transport analysis in support of a safety evaluation of the future Belgian near-surface radioactive waste disposal facility. Our reference coarse-grid groundwater flow model was coupled with a smaller fine sub-grid model in two different ways. While the reference flow model was calibrated using observed groundwater levels at a scale commensurate with that of the coarse-grid model, the fine sub-grid model was used to run a solute transport simulation quantifying concentrations in a hypothetical well nearby the disposal facility. When LGR coupling was compared to a one-way coupling, LGR was found to provide a smoother flow solution resulting in a more CPU-efficient transport solution. Parameter sensitivities performed with the groundwater flow model resulted in sensitivities at the head observation locations. These sensitivities identified the recharge as the most sensitive parameter, with the hydraulic conductivity of the upper aquifer as the second most sensitive parameter in regard to calculated groundwater heads. Based on one-percent sensitivity maps, the spatial distribution of the observations with the highest sensitivities is slightly different for the upper aquifer hydraulic conductivity than for recharge. Sensitivity analyses were further performed to assess the prediction scaled sensitivities for hypothetical contaminant concentrations using the combined groundwater flow and solute transport models. Including all pertinent parameters into the sensitivity analysis identified the hydraulic conductivity of the upper aquifer as the most sensitive parameter with regard to the prediction of contaminant concentrations.",,"Gedeon, M|Mallants, D",MATHEMATICAL GEOSCIENCES,groundwater flow modeling solute transport modeling local-grid refinement sensitivity analysis,10.1007/s11004-012-9416-3

A. fatua is the most widespread herbicide-resistant weed in the world, infesting about  million hectares in  countries. The use of alternative herbicides with different modes of action has proved effective. Several cultural practices, including diverse crop rotations, cover crops, improved crop competition (using competitive cultivars, high seed rates, narrow row spacing, altered crop geometry), and allelopathic suppression, have shown promise for controlling A. fatua and A. ludoviciana. The integrated use of these cultural methods can reduce the herbicide dose required, and lower dependency on herbicides to control these grasses. Moreover, integrated management may successfully control herbicide-resistant populations of these weed species. The use of integrated approaches based on the knowledge of biology and ecology of A. fatua and A. ludoviciana may help to manage them sustainably in the future.",,"Bajwa, AA|Akhter, MJ|Iqbal, N|Peerzada, AM|Hanif, Z|Manalil, S|Hashim, S|Ali, HH|Kebaso, L|Frimpong, D|Namubiru, H|Chauhan, BS",ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH,wild oats cereals weed management herbicide resistance crop competition,10.1007/s11356-017-9810-y

With this knowledge sections of the canal system which are identified as sensitive to flow perturbations should be targeted for more frequent inspection and operational decisions than others. The steady-state hydraulic approach for canal operation design is well understood by irrigation agencies, but it has limited practical application and is unsuitable for studying the propagation of perturbations. The unsteady flow approach is more powerful but rather complex. A third intermediate way is proposed here through the development of hydraulic sensitivity indicators. These indicators allow the characterization of the response of a structure, or a set of structures, to any input change. Local sensitivity indicators are first estimated for the main hydraulic structures, i.e. offtakes and cross-regulators, for delivery and conveyance. Aggregation processes are then proposed for the computation of lumped sensitivity indicators at reach and canal levels. These sensitivity indicators are designed to improve the knowledge of canal behavior and to lead to improved monitoring and operation of irrigation canals.

Second, we discuss briefly the various elemental error sources that contribute to the uncertainties of the ADCP measured variables, which in turn contribute to the total uncertainty of ADCP discharge measurements. In discussing the elemental errors, we look into what determines their uncertainties and whether they can be evaluated using available information.

In isogeometric approach, however, the geometric properties of design are embedded into the NURBS basis functions and the control points whose perturbation naturally results in shape changes. Thus, exact geometric models can be used in both response and shape sensitivity analyses, where normal vector and curvature are continuous over the whole design space so that enhanced shape sensitivity can be obtained. In the problems of shape optimal design, refinements and design changes are easily implemented within the isogeometric framework, which maintains exact geometry without subsequent communication with CAD description. The variation of control points results in shape changes and is continuous over the whole design space.

Model calibration is thus an essential task to obtain the optimal parameter values, which match simulations with observations as closely as possible. This study used the Zenne River Basin (Belgium) as a case study, which experiences high spatial heterogeneity in terms of geological formation, groundwater recharge, and rainfall-runoff responses. Therefore, the objectives of this paper were to calibrate the SWAT model on the basis of different calibration techniques and identify which technique is suitable for such a heterogeneous basin so that the calibrated SWAT can be used as a tool for integrated management of the Zenne River Basin. Prior to calibration, the sensitive parameters were identified on the basis of a detailed sensitivity analysis (SA) of the Latin hypercube one-factor-at-a-time (LH-OAT) technique and increased sampling intervals. Then, SWAT was calibrated by using single-site calibration (SSC) at the watershed outlet; sequential calibration (SC), calibration from upstream to downstream; and simultaneous multisite calibration (SMSC), where data of two flow gauging stations were simultaneously used in a single calibration. It was found that at least  sampling intervals should be considered for the LH-OAT SA method to obtain converged rankings of SWAT parameters. In addition, to well capture the spatial variability of heterogeneous catchment and achieve stable sensitivity ranking, simultaneous multisite SA technique is important. Streamflow findings suggested that the SC and the SMSC techniques provided very good results and significantly improved model performance, but the SSC results were merely satisfactory. Though the results of SC and SMSC techniques were similar, the SMSC was selected over SC because it simultaneously handles the entire catchment spatial variability by assigning different parameter values and allows data information communication among stations in a single calibration. It was thus concluded that simultaneous multisite calibration should be considered for catchments with a high spatial variability like the Zenne River Basin.",,"Leta, OT|van Griensven, A|Bauwens, W",JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGIC ENGINEERING,calibration multisite streamflow soil and water assessment tool (swat) zenne river basin belgium,10.1061/(ASCE)HE.1943-5584.0001471

We show that an optimal adaptation trajectory (OAT) through the set of possible encodings exists, and that it indicates how to adapt encoding quality in response to changes in network conditions in order to maximise User-perceived quality. The OAT is related to the characteristics of the content, in terms of spatial and temporal complexity. We describe a method to automatically determine the OAT in response to the time-varying characteristics of the content. In this way, as the characteristics of the content change over time, the system can dynamically and intelligently adjust the adaptation process in order to maximise the user-perceived quality. The OAT can be used with any sender-based transmission adaptation policy. We demonstrate content-based adaptation using the OAT in a practical system using two different adaptation algorithms. Furthermore, we show how this form of adaptation can result in differing adaptation behaviour not only as a result of the dynamics of the content but also as a result of the adaptation algorithm being used.

Many air quality studies require sensitivity analyses, i.e., the computation of derivatives of the model output with respect to model parameters. The derivatives of a cost functional (defined on the model output) with respect to a large number of model parameters can be calculated efficiently through adjoint sensitivity analysis. While the traditional (first order) adjoint models give the gradient of the cost functional with respect to parameters, second order adjoint models give second derivative information in the form of products between the Hessian of the cost functional and a vector (representing a perturbation in sensitivity analysis, a search direction in optimization, an eigenvector, etc.). In this paper we discuss the mathematical foundations of the discrete second order adjoint sensitivity method and present a complete set of computational tools for performing second order sensitivity studies in three-dimensional atmospheric CTMs. The tools include discrete second order adjoints of Runge-Kutta and of Rosenbrock time stepping methods for stiff equations together with efficient implementation strategies.

Two approaches were used to study the ozone formation potentials or source reactivities of different anthropogenic organic compounds emission categories in California's South Coast Air Basin (SoCAB). The first approach was based on the combination of total organic gases (TOG) emission speciation profiles and the maximum incremental reactivity (MIR) scale of organic species. The second approach quantified ozone impacts from different emission sources by performing -dimensional air quality model sensitivity analysis involving increased TOG emissions from particular sources. The source reactivities derived from these two approaches agree reasonably well for  anthropogenic organic compounds emission categories in the SoCAB. Both approaches identify TOG emissions from mobile sources as having the highest reactivity. Source reactivities from both approaches were also combined with TOG emissions from each source category to produce a  reactivity-based anthropogenic TOG emission inventory for the SoCAB. The top five reactivity-based anthropogenic TOG emission sources in the SoCAB during  were: light-duty passenger cars, off-road equipment, consumer products, light-duty trucks category  (i.e., - lb), and recreational boats. This is in contrast to the mass-based TOG emission inventory, which indicates that livestock waste and composting emission categories were two of the five largest mass-based anthropogenic TOG emission sources. The reactivity-based TOG emission inventory is an important addition to the mass-based TOG emission inventory because it represents the ozone formation potentials from emission sources and can be used to assist in determining targeted sources for developing organic compounds reduction policies.

These algorithms are based on the three-dimensional skeletonization that simplifies the pore space to networks in the form of nodes connected to paths. Dilation algorithms were developed to generate inscribed spheres on the nodes and paths of the medial axis to represent pore-bodies and pore-throats of the network, respectively. The end result is a physically representative pore network structure, i.e. three-dimensional spatial distribution (i.e. x-, y-, and z-coordinates) of pore-bodies and pore-throats, pore-body size distribution, pore-throat size distribution, and the connectivity. Systems analyzed in this study include different glass bead systems and natural marine sand. The media ranged in size from . to . mm, while the image volumes ranged between . and . mm(). In addition to extracting the pore network structure, the porosity, specific surface area, and representative elementary volume analysis on the porosity were calculated. Spatial correlation between pore-body sizes in the network was investigated using semivariograms and integral scale concepts. The impact of resolution on the calculated property was also investigated. In this work, we show that microtomography is an effective tool to non-destructively extract the structure of many systems. The quality of the datasets depends on photon energy, photon flux, size of the sample, type of the sample, and size of the sample 'features'. Results show that the developed method of extracting pore network structure is applicable to ideal and natural porous media systems. The impact of resolution on the quantification of the network structure properties varies in its significance based on feature size of the system and the properties being calculated.

SA is a commonly used approach for identifying important parameters that dominate model behavior. As such, SA address two elementary questions in the modeling exercise, namely, how sensitive is the model to changes in individual parameter values, and which parameters or associated processes have more influence on the results. In this paper we report on a local SA performed on a complex marine biogeochemical model that simulates oxygen, organic matter and nutrient cycles (N, P and Si) in the water column, and well as the dynamics of biological groups such as producers, consumers and decomposers. SA was performed using a one at a time parameter perturbation method, and a color-code matrix was developed for result visualization.

Since geometric uncertainty is embedded in the boundary which is dynamic and changes continuously in the optimization process, topology optimization under geometric uncertainty (TOGU) poses extreme difficulty to the already challenging topology optimization problems. This paper aims to solve this cutting-edge problem by integrating the latest developments in level set methods, design under uncertainty, and a newly developed mathematical framework for solving variational problems and partial differential equations that define mappings between different manifolds. There are several contributions of this work. First, geometric uncertainty is quantitatively modeled by combing level set equation with a random normal boundary velocity field characterized with a reduced set of random variables using the Karhunen-Loeve expansion. Multivariate Gauss quadrature is employed to propagate the geometric uncertainty, which also facilitates shape sensitivity analysis by transforming a TOGU problem into a weighted summation of deterministic topology optimization problems. Second, a PDE-based approach is employed to overcome the deficiency of conventional level set model which cannot explicitly maintain the point correspondences between the current and the perturbed boundaries. With the explicit point correspondences, shape sensitivity defined on different perturbed designs can be mapped back to the current design. The proposed method is demonstrated with a bench mark structural design.

It is the next step in the evolution of generic crop templates for APSIM, building on software and science lessons from past versions and capitalising on new software approaches. The PMF contains a top-level Plant class that provides an interface with the APSIM model environment and controls the other classes in the plant model. Other classes include mid-level Organ, Phenology, Structure and Arbitrator classes that represent specific elements or processes of the crop and sub-classes that the mid-level classes use to represent repeated data structures. It also contains low-level Function classes which represent generic mathematical, logical, procedural or reference code and provide values to the processes carried out by mid-level classes. A plant configuration file specifies which mid-level and Function classes are to be included and how they are to be arranged and parameterised to represent a particular crop model. The PMF has an integrated design environment to allow plant models to be created visually. The aims of the PMF are to maximise code reuse and allow flexibility in the structure of models. Four examples are included to demonstrate the flexibility of application of the PMF; . Slurp, a simple model of the water use of a static crop, . Oat, an annual grain crop model with detailed growth, development and resource use processes, . Lucerne. perennial forage model with detailed growth, development and resource use processes, .

Different watershed areas are not necessarily hydrologically similar and impose variable effects on the outlet flow hydrograph. Meanwhile, prioritization of watershed areas in terms of flood generation is essential for economic flood control planning. Previous works have focused on the definition of a flood index that quantifies the contribution of each subwatershed unit or grid cell to the outlet flood hydrograph through the application of unit flood response (UFR) approach. In the present research, for the first time, the effect of spatial pattern of storm events on the flood index variation was assessed via a Monte Carlo uncertainty analysis. To do so, the UFR approach was carried out for a large number of randomly generated rainfall spatial pattern. The proposed methodology was adopted to the Tangrah watershed in northern Iran. The watershed is frequently hit by floods that have historically caused loss of life and properties. The results indicated that for the more frequent flood events, the flood index is quite sensitive to the spatial distribution of rainfall such that for the highest ranked subwatershed (SW), the standardized variation of the flood index values (i.e., the uncertainty range) decreases from . to . when the rainfall depth increases from  to  mm, respectively. The results further revealed that increasing the rainfall depth from  to  mm would cause the effect of rainfall spatial distribution on subwatersheds' flood indices to diminish. The implications are that if flood control measures are designed for more frequent floods with lower return periods, an uncertainty analysis is required to identify the range of flood index variations.",,"Saghafian, B|Golian, S|Elmi, M|Akhtari, R",NATURAL HAZARDS,flood source ufr method uncertainty rainfall spatial distribution,10.1007/s11069-012-0537-2

Current challenges in the application of these tools include: () accounting for large uncertainty in model parameters, which may violate assumptions of ""local"" perturbation metrics such as sensitivities and elasticities, and () forecasting not only asymptotic rates of spatial spread, as is usually done, but also transient spatial dynamics in the early stages of invasion. We developed an invasion model for the Diaprepes root weevil (DRW; Diaprepes abbreviatus [Coleoptera: Curculionidae]), a generalist herbivore that has invaded citrus-growing regions of the United States. We synthesized data on DRW demography and dispersal and generated predictions for asymptotic and transient peak invasion speeds, accounting for parameter uncertainty. We quantified the contributions of each parameter toward invasion speed using a ""global"" perturbation analysis, and we contrasted parameter contributions during the transient and asymptotic phases. We found that the asymptotic invasion speed was .-. km/week, although the transient peak invasion speed (.- . km/week) was significantly greater. Both asymptotic and transient invasions speeds were most responsive to weevil dispersal distances. However, demographic parameters that had large effects on asymptotic speed (e.g., survival of early-instar larvae) had little effect on transient speed. Comparison of the global analysis with lower-level elasticities indicated that local perturbation analysis would have generated unreliable predictions for the responsiveness of invasion speed to underlying parameters. Observed range expansion in southern Florida (-) was significantly lower than the invasion speed predicted by the model. Possible causes of this mismatch include overestimation of dispersal distances, demographic rates, and spatiotemporal variation in parameter values. This study demonstrates, that, when parameter uncertainty is large, as is often the case, global perturbation analyses are needed to identify which points in the life cycle should be targets of management.

Several models in use in the risk analysis field are characterized by the presence of deterministic relationships among the input parameters. However, SA issues related to the presence of constraints have been mainly dealt with in a heuristic fashion. We start with a systematic analysis of the effects of constraints. The findings can be summarized in the following three effects. (i) Constraints make it impossible to vary one parameter while keeping all others fixed. (ii) The model output becomes insensitive to a parameter if a constraint is solved for that parameter. (iii) Sensitivity analysis results depend on which parameter is selected as dependent. The explanation of these effects is found by proposing a result that leads to a natural extension of the local SA rationale introduced in Helton (). We then extend the definitions of the Birnbaum, criticality, and the differential importance measures to the constrained case. In addition, a procedure is introduced that allows to obtain constrained sensitivity results at the same cost as in the absence of constraints.

Despite many years of active remediation, the groundwater remains acidic and contaminated with significant levels of U(VI) and other radionuclides. Monitored Natural Attenuation (MNA) is a desired closure strategy for the site, based on the premise that regional flow of dean background groundwater will eventually neutralize the groundwater acidity, immobilizing U(VI) through adsorption. An in situ treatment system is currently in place to accelerate this in the downgradient portion of the plume and similar measures could be taken upgradient if necessary. Understanding the long-term pH and U(VI) adsorption behavior at the site is critical to assess feasibility of MNA along with the in-situ remediation treatments. This paper presents a reactive transport (RT) model and uncertainty quantification (UQ) analyses to explore key controls on the U(VI)-plume evolution and long-term mobility at this site. Two-dimensional numerical RT simulations are run including the saturated and unsaturated (vadose) zones, U(VI) and H+ adsorption (surface complexation) onto sediments, dissolution and precipitation of Al and Fe minerals, and key hydrodynamic processes are considered. UQ techniques are applied using a new open-source tool that is part of the developing ASCEM reactive transport modeling and analysis framework to: () identify the complex physical and geochemical processes that control the U(VI) plume migration in the pH range where the plume is highly mobile, () evaluate those physical and geochemical parameters that are most controlling, and () predict the future plume evolution constrained by historical, chemical and hydrological data. The RT simulation results show a good agreement with the observed historical pH and concentrations of U(VI), nitrates and Al concentrations at multiple locations. Mineral dissolution and precipitation combined with adsorption reactions on goethite and kaolinite (the main minerals present with quartz) could buffer pH at the site for long periods of time. UQ analysis using the Morris one-at-a-time (OAT) method indicates that the model/parameter is most sensitive to the pH of the waste solution, discharge rates, and the reactive surface area available for adsorption. However, as a key finding, UQ analysis also indicates that this model (and parameters) sensitivity evolves in space and time, and its understanding could be crucial to assess the temporal efficiency of a remediation strategy in contaminated sites.

The QDE approaches evaluate input information uncertainty subsurface model sensitivity and,, most importantly, output covariance to identify the next location to sample. Spatial input parameter values and covariances are calculated with the multivariate conditional probability calculation from a limited number of samples. A variogram structure is used during data extrapolation to describe the spatial continuity or correlation of subsurface information. Model,, sensitivity can be determined by perturbing input data and evaluating output response or, as in this work, sensitivities can be programmed directly into an analysis model. Output covariance is calculated by the First-Order Second Moment (FOSM) method, which combines the covariance of input information with model sensitivity. A groundwater flow example, modeled in MODFLOW-, is chosen to demonstrate the seven QDE approaches. MODFLOW- is used to obtain the piezometric head and the model sensitivity simultaneously. The seven QDE approaches are evaluated based on the accuracy of the modeled piezometric head after information from a QDE sample is added. For the synthetic site used in this study, the QDE approach that identifies the location of hydraulic conductivity that contributes the most to the overall piezometric head variance proved to be the best method to quantitatively direct exploration.",,"Graettinger, AJ|Lee, J|Reeves, HW|Dethan, D",JOURNAL OF HYDROINFORMATICS,directed exploration fosm modflow taylor series uncertainty analysis,10.2166/hydro.2006.006

Most studies have focused on how the subsurface conditions control the AS process; however, the ""sideeffects"" of AS that feed back to subsurface environment have not been well addressed. This paper studied the perturbation of porous media induced by AS and the consequent multi-parameter changes with the support of Miller soil box and resistivity test, and Darcy experiment and tracer breakthrough test. The Miller soil box test shows that the resistivity response can be credibly used as a non-intrusive method to indicate the porosity change, and that the porosity-resistivity data can be well fitted using Archie equation (R- > .). Based upon the electricity measurement and above quantitive relationship, it was found that the porosity increased near the air injection point and decreased near the upper boundary of the column due to the upward-transport of particles during air sparging. The changes in porosity were found to be directly proportional to the air injection rate, and the maximum absolute variation of porosity was up to . at the air flow rate of  ml/min, while it did not change in the absence of AS. Both the hydraulic conductivity and dispersion coefficient increased after AS perturbation as the preferential flow pathway formed. The two parameters changed from . m/d and . to . m/d and ., respectively, at  ml/min. This work provides useful insight into the changes in flow and transport properties of porous media induced by AS, which then help to understand the instability of air flow and the parameter-uncertainty analysis in related AS model.",,"Zhao, HF|Yang, JK|Fan, W|Huo, MX|Ma, YH|Liu, L|Yang, X",WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION,air sparging perturbation porosity hydraulic conductivity dispersion coefficient,10.1007/s11270-017-3412-7

We tested a food web accumulation model, including sorption to CM, on data from a model ecosystem experiment with historically contaminated sediment. In combination with measured CM contents of the sediment, the model gave good fits for the biota that are known not to metabolize PAHs (macrophytes, periphyton, floating algal biomass). The same model was applied to invertebrates and fish but now with optimization of their metabolic transformation rates (km). For fish, these rates correlated empirically with log K-OW: Log k(m), = -. log K-OW + . (r() (adj) = .). For invertebrates, log km did not correlate with logK(OW). Sensitivity analysis revealed that the model output is highly sensitive to sediment CM content and sorption parameters, moderately sensitive to metabolic transformation rates, and slightly sensitive to lipid fraction of the organism and diet-related parameters. It is concluded that CM-inclusive models yield a better assessment of accumulation than models without sorption to CM.

Our aim is to quantify our confidence on simulation scenarios by an available morphodynamic model for the shape. The approach permits to perform this task at low complexity as it does not require any sampling of the bed receptivity parameter space. The paper goes beyond stationarity for the variability of the bed receptivity by linking its dynamics to the bottom morphodynamics through an original transport equation for the local bed receptivity standard deviation. The approach has been applied to the analysis of bed morphodynamics based on minimization principles.

This interest stems from the realization that the achieved high-performance designs resulted from deterministic topology optimization algorithms may become suboptimal under real-world conditions that are often accompanied with uncertainties. Among sources of these uncertainties, the ones that define structural characteristics, such as geometry, are numerically challenging to treat as they lead to stochastic structural stiffness. To date, research on developing efficient probabilistic topology optimization under stochastic stiffness is mainly focused on displacement-based objectives. However, in the design of structures, stress is also a primary design criterion that needs to be directly controlled for. A robust stress-based topology optimization methodology for frame structures under geometric uncertainty is proposed in this work. Assuming that such uncertainties are small relative to frame member lengths, the proposed methodology uses stochastic perturbation method to propagate these uncertainties up to the response level, which is expressed by the maximum of expected values of von Mises stresses throughout the domain. Sensitivities of the response with respect to design variables are derived analytically, which allows using efficient gradient-based optimizers. The proposed algorithm is examined with stress-based design of three frame structures under geometric uncertainty. Changes in the topology of these new designs are discussed, and they are shown to outperform deterministic designs when subjected to geometric uncertainties. Moreover, predictions and the resulting designs from the proposed methodology are found to be in excellent agreement with Monte Carlo simulation results.", (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The aim of the study is to quantify the impact of different types of uncertainties that arise from the unresolved soil spatial variability on simulated hydrological states and fluxes. Three perturbation methods are presented for the characterization of uncertainties in soil properties. The methods are applied on the soil map of the upper Neckar catchment (Germany), as an example. The uncertainties are propagated through the distributed mesoscale hydrological model (mHM) to assess the impact on the simulated states and fluxes. The model outputs are analysed by aggregating the results at different spatial and temporal scales. These results show that the impact of the different uncertainties introduced in the original soil map is equivalent when the simulated model outputs are analysed at the model grid resolution (i.e.  m). However, several differences are identified by aggregating states and fluxes at different spatial scales (by subcatchments of different sizes or coarsening the grid resolution). Streamflow is only sensitive to the perturbation of long spatial structures while distributed states and fluxes (e.g. soil moisture and groundwater recharge) are only sensitive to the local noise introduced to the original soil properties. A clear identification of the temporal and spatial scale for which finer-resolution soil information is (or is not) relevant is unlikely to be universal. However, the comparison of the impacts on the different hydrological components can be used to prioritize the model improvements in specific applications, either by collecting new measurements or by calibration and data assimilation approaches. In conclusion, the study underlines the importance of a correct characterization of uncertainty in soil properties. With that, soil maps with additional information regarding the unresolved soil spatial variability would provide strong support to hydrological modelling applications.",,"Baroni, G|Zink, M|Kumar, R|Samaniego, L|Attinger, S",HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES,,10.5194/hess-21-2301-2017

Identification methods based on spectroscopic properties, leaf forms and chlorophyll fluorescence have been developed. Leaf overlap is a major difficulty and most of the proposed methods only operate on isolated leaves. The present study focused on the leaf overlap problem by analysing colour photographs of a mixed cultivation of oat (Avena sativa) and a dicot weed (dandelion, Taraxacum officinale, TAROF). Leaves of the two species appeared to have very similar colours and therefore species identification was based on the different textures of monocot and dicot leaves. An automatic classifier, based on the RankRLS learning algorithm, was developed in the study and trained with manually labelled parts of the photographs. We adopted a strategy in which the misclassification of oat pixels to TAROF was avoided at the expense of classifying most TAROF pixels as oat. This strategy is appropriate when the aim of the automatic identification is to guide a herbicide sprayer. In photograph-wise cross-validation, the misclassification of oat as TAROF was negligible and considerably smaller than the expected amount of misclassifications, indicating that leaf texture is useful for identification of plant species in this very demanding case.", (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The aerodynamic uncertainty is more complicated than the structural one, and it takes more significant effect on the flutter boundary. First, the nominal unsteady aerodynamic influence coefficients were calculated with the doublet lattice method. Based on this nominal model, the stochastic uncertainty model for unsteady aerodynamic pressure coefficients was constructed with physical meaning. Afterwards, the methodology for flutter uncertainty quantification due to aerodynamic perturbation was developed, based on the nonintrusive polynomial chaos expansion theory. In order to enhance the computational efficiency, the integration algorithm, namely, Smolyak sparse grids, was employed to calculate the coefficients of the stochastic polynomial basis. Finally, the flutter uncertainty analysis methodology was applied to an aircraft's wing model. The influence of uncertainty with uniform distribution for aerodynamic pressure coefficients on flutter boundary was quantified. The numerical results indicate that, the influence of unsteady aerodynamic pressure due to the motion of coupling modes takes significant effect on flutter boundary.

A method is proposed that is shown to give accurate estimates of design sensitivities when remeshing operations are performed during the analysis. Sensitivity analysis for the consistent finite element treatment of near incompressibility within the context of the assumed strain methods is also proposed. In particular, the performance of four-noded quadrilateral elements for the sensitivity analysis of large deformations is studied. The results of the continuum sensitivity analysis are validated by a comparison with those obtained by a finite difference approximation (i.e. using the solution of a perturbed deformation problem).

The problem is formulated using a level set description of the geometry and the extended finite element method ( XFEM) to enable an easy treatment of complex geometries. A key issue comes from the sensitivity analysis of the structural responses with respect to the design parameters ruling the boundaries. Even if the approach does not imply any mesh modification, the study shows that shape modifications lead to difficulties when the perturbation of the level sets modifies the set of extended finite elements. To circumvent the problem, an analytical sensitivity analysis of the structural system is developed. Differences between the sensitivity analysis using FEM or XFEM are put in evidence. To conduct the sensitivity analysis, an efficient approach to evaluate the so-called velocity field is developed within the XFEM domain. The proposed approach determines a continuous velocity field in a boundary layer around the zero level set using a local finite element approximation. The analytical sensitivity analysis is validated against the finite differences and a semi-analytical approach.

In this contribution, the characteristic properties of the test are described. Methods. The test can be performed either with Brassica rapa (turnip) or Avena sativa (oat). Its duration is  to  days with OECD artificial soil and a German standard field soil acting as controls. Water and nutrients are provided by an automatic wick irrigation system. Besides measuring biomass and shoot length, the number of pods, seeds and flowers are applied as chronic measurement endpoints. During the development of the test, TNT (,,-trinitrotoluene) and Pyrene were used as model test substances. Results. Pyrene did not affect B. rapa (turnip) in concentrations of up to , mg/kg soil (due to the often low sensitivity of A. sativa (oat) no further test with this substance was performed).

In our previous study [], we considered saturation of a non-electrolytic nutrient and its release from a spherically coated fertilizer granule, assuming only molecular diffusion. In the present study, release of three types of nutrients (NPK) from their commonly used commercial fertilizer sources, stuffed in a coated spherical fertilizer granule is investigated using both molecular and ionic diffusions. One of the nutrients is potassium chloride (KCl), a strong electrolyte, the other is diammonium phosphate ((NH())()HPO()), a weak electrolyte, and the third is urea ((NH())()CO), a non-electrolyte. The release takes place from the granule's surface area in contact with the soil. The contact area is varied from almost a point to the lower hemisphere with the help of a parameter. The latter case helps to evaluate the release time for basal form of fertilizer application. The effects of granule radius, nutrients release rate, contact area, association constant, pH, and temperature on the release time of nutrients are studied. Variations in release time are much more pronounced from a spherical granule of larger radius having almost point contact with alkaline soil at higher temperatures and for a weak electrolyte of lower association constant. The release time is computed using the techniques of deterministic mathematical modeling and computer simulation. Sensitivity analysis has also been done by giving small variations in the parameters of pH modulator, in the ionic diffusion coefficients of strong and weak-electrolytes and evaluating root mean squared deviations (RMSD) in release time. Values of RMSDs are negligible, establishing the stability and accuracy of the technique used.

Oat is a moderately salt-tolerant crop and can contribute to improving saline soil. The physiological and molecular responses of the oat plant to long-term salinity were studied. After a -day salt treatment ( mmol L-NaCl in Hoagland's solution), photosynthetic rate, maximum photosystem II photochemical efficiency, and actual efficiency of photosystem II decreased. The activities of superoxide dismutase, peroxidase, and catalase significantly increased. We also investigated the protein profiles of oat leaves in response to salinity and detected  reproducible protein spots by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis that were differentially abundant. Specifically, one protein was up-regulated and  proteins were down-regulated compared with the control. These  proteins were identified using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, and  corresponding genes were further investigated by quantitative real-time PCR. These proteins were involved in four types of biological processes: photosynthesis, carbohydrate metabolism and energy, protein biosynthesis, and folding and detoxification. This study indicates that the lower levels of Calvin cycle-related proteins, S ribosomal protein L and adenosine-triphosphate regulation-related proteins, and the high levels of antioxidant enzymes play important roles in the response of oat to long-term salinity stress.",,"Bai, JH|Qin, Y|Liu, JH|Wang, YQ|Sa, RL|Zhang, N|Jia, RZ",ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH,salinity stress oat proteomics antioxidant enzymes photosynthesis,10.1007/s11356-016-8092-0

This task is formulated as a constrained optimization problem with a cost functional of least squares type using information obtained from measurements. An important issue in the numerical solution of this type of problem is the control of the errors introduced, first, by discretization of the equations describing the physical model, and second, by measurement errors or other perturbations. Our strategy is as follows: we suppose that the user defines an interest functional , which might depend on both the state variable and the parameters and which represents the goal of the computation. First, we propose an a posteriori error estimator which measures the error with respect to this functional. This error estimator is used in an adaptive algorithm to construct economic meshes by local mesh refinement. The proposed estimator requires the solution of an auxiliary linear equation, Second, we address the question of sensitivity. Applying similar techniques as before, we derive quantities which describe the influence of small changes in the measurements on the value of the interest functional. These numbers, which we call relative condition numbers, give additional information on the problem under consideration.

However, it tends to suffer from premature convergence and loses the abilities of exploration and exploitation when solving complex problems. This paper presents an improved gravitational search algorithm (IGSA) that first employs chaotic perturbation operator and then considers memory strategy to overcome the aforementioned problems. The chaotic operator can enhance its global convergence to escape from local optima, and the memory strategy provides a faster convergence and shares individual's best fitness history to improve the exploitation ability. After that, convergence analysis of the proposed IGSA is presented based on discrete-time linear system theory and results show that IGSA is not only guaranteed to converge under the conditions, but can converge to the global optima with the probability . Finally, choice of reasonable parameters for IGSA is discussed on four typical benchmark test functions based on sensitivity analysis. Moreover, IGSA is tested against a suite of benchmark functions with excellent results and is compared to GA, PSO, HS, WDO, CFO, APO and other well- known GSA variants presented in the literatures.

To reduce the stability-related problems, a special technique is utilized, by which the response analysis is always terminated before the first critical point is reached. In this way, the optimization is always related to a precritical structural state. The necessary load-carrying capability of the optimal structure is assured by extending the usual formulation of the optimization problem by a constraint on an estimated critical load factor. Since limit points are easier to handle, the possible presence of bifurcation points is avoided by introducing imperfection parameters. They are related to an asymmetric shape perturbation of the structure. During the optimization, the imperfection parameters are updated to get automatically the 'worst-case' pattern and amplitude of the imperfection. Both, the imperfection parameters and the design variables are related to the structural shape via the design element technique. A gradient-based optimizer is employed to solve the optimization problem.

However, one of the key challenges for experimental design is that the local sensitivity is dependent on the unknown parameter values for a nonlinear model. This problem can be addressed if the sensitivity matrix, used in experimental design, could be computed by global sensitivity analysis techniques rather than local sensitivity analysis methods. However, not all existing global sensitivity analysis measures can compute such a sensitivity matrix. This paper presents a necessary condition for integrating global sensitivity analysis with experimental design criteria, i.e., the design criterion of the global sensitivity matrix reduces to the one applied to the local sensitivity matrix if the parameter uncertainty range tends to zero. Four different sensitivity measures are analyzed using this condition and the results are illustrated in a detailed case study where a comparison with local design and Bayesian design is made.

The overall approach builds on an immersed boundary method that couples a Lagrangian formulation of the structure to an Eulerian fluid model, discretized on a deforming mesh. The geometry of the fluid-structure boundary is manipulated by varying the nodal parameters of a discretized level set field. This approach allows for topological changes of the fluid-structure interface, but free-floating volumes of solid material can emerge in the course of the optimization process. The free-floating volumes are tracked and modeled as fluid in the FSI analysis. To sense the isolated solid volumes, an indicator field described by linear, isotropic diffusion is computed prior to analyzing the FSI response of a design. The fluid is modeled with the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, and the structure is assumed linear elastic. The FSI model is discretized by an extended finite element method, and the fluid-structure coupling conditions are enforced weakly. The resulting nonlinear system of equations is solved monolithically with Newton's method. The design sensitivities are computed by the adjoint method and the optimization problem is solved by a gradient-based algorithm. The characteristics of this optimization framework are studied with two-dimensional problems at steady state. Numerical results indicate that the proposed treatment of free-floating volumes introduces a discontinuity in the design evolution, yet the method is still successful in converging to meaningful designs.",,"Jenkins, N|Maute, K",STRUCTURAL AND MULTIDISCIPLINARY OPTIMIZATION,topology optimization nitsche extended finite element method level set method fluid-structure interaction heart valve,10.1007/s00158-016-1467-5

Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of simple (glucose, xylose and sucrose) and complex (acid and enzymatic oat straw hydrolysates) substrates on the continuous hydrogen production in a trickling bed reactor. Novel inoculum (triticale silage) and biofilm support configuration (vertically organized PET tubing) were tested. RESULTSThe enzymatic hydrolysate was a suitable substrate for hydrogen production, since its hydrogen molar yield was similar to that obtained with glucose, mean values of . and . mol H- mol(-) sugar consumed were obtained, respectively. In contrast, hydrogen was not produced from the acid hydrolysate. The highest hydrogen production rate ( mL H- L- h(-)) was obtained with glucose at an organic loading rate of  g COD L- d(-). In spite of the high organic loading rate applied, clogging due to excessive biomass growth was not observed. Finally, PCR-DGGE analysis revealed that bacteria from Clostridium genus were the putative responsible for hydrogen production.

Transformation SEMs are useful tools for tackling the non-normality of multidimensional data and simultaneously revealing the interrelationships among latent variables. The main objective of this paper is to develop a Bayesian diagnostic procedure for transformation SEMs. The first- and second-order local inference measures are established with the objective functions that are defined based on the logarithm of Bayes Factor. Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods with the Bayesian P-splines approach are developed to compute the local influence measures and to estimate nonparametric transformations, latent variables, and unknown parameters. Compared with conventional maximum likelihood-based diagnostic procedures, the Bayesian diagnostic approach could detect outliers and/or influential points in the observed data, as well as conduct model comparison and sensitivity analysis through various perturbations of the data, sampling distributions, or prior distributions of the model parameters.

To describe this behaviour at the river-basin scale, integrated hydrological and water quality models are needed. A crucial step in understanding the various processes determining pesticide fate is to perform a sensitivity analysis. Sensitivity analysis for hydrology and pesticide supply in SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) will provide useful support for the development of a reliable hydrological model and will give insight in which parameters are most sensitive concerning pesticide supply towards rivers. The study was performed on the Nil catchment in Belgium. In this study we utilised an LH-OAT sensitivity analysis. The LH-OAT method combines the One-factor-At-a-Time (OAT) design and Latin Hypercube (LH) sampling by taking the Latin Hypercube samples as initial points for an OAT design. By means of the LH-OAT sensitivity analysis, the dominant hydrological parameters were determined and a reduction of the number of model parameters was performed. Dominant hydrological parameters were the curve number (CN), the surface runoff lag (surlag), the recharge to deep aquifer (rchrg_dp) and the threshold depth of water in the shallow aquifer (GWQMN). Next, the selected parameters were estimated by manual calibration. Hereby, the Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency improved from an initial value of -. to +.. In the second part, sensitivity analyses were performed to provide insight in which parameters or model inputs contribute most to variance in pesticide output. The results of this study show that for the Nil catchment, hydrologic parameters are dominant in controlling pesticide predictions. The other parameter that affects pesticide concentrations in surface water is 'apfp_pest', which meaning was changed into a parameter that controls direct losses to the river system (e.g., through the clean up of spray equipment, leaking tools, processing of spray waste on paved surfaces). As a consequence, it is of utmost importance that hydrology is well calibrated while-in this case-a correct estimation of the direct losses is of importance as well. Besides, a study of only the pesticide related parameters, i.e. application rate (kg/ha), application time (day), etc., reveals that the application time has much more impact than the application rate, which has itself a higher impact than errors in the daily rainfall observations.

A canonical form for sparsity preserving perturbations is given and a computable formula for the corresponding structured pseudospectra is derived. This formula relates the computation of structured pseudospectra to the computation of the structured singular value (ssv) of an associated matrix. Although the computation of the ssv in general is an NP-hard problem, algorithms for its approximation are available and demonstrate good performance when applied to the computation of structured pseudospectra of medium-sized or highly sparse matrices. The method is applied to a wing vibration problem, where it is compared with the matrix polynomial approach, and to the stability analysis of truss structures.

More and more unused land is currently reclaimed in the regions of the former Soviet Union. Driven by climate change, the Western Siberian grain belt might, in a long-term, even expand into the drained peatland areas to the North. It is crucial to study the consequences of this land-use change with respect to the carbon cycling as this is still a major knowledge gap. We present for the first time data on the atmosphere-ecosystem exchange of carbon dioxide and methane of an arable field and a neighboring unused grassland on peat soil in Western Siberia. Eddy covariance measurements were performed over one vegetation period. No directed methane fluxes were found due to an effective drainage of the study sites. The carbon dioxide fluxes appeared to be of high relevance for the global carbon and greenhouse gas cycles. They showed very site-specific patterns resulting from the development of vegetation: the persistent plants of the grassland were able to start photosynthesizing soon after snow melt, while the absence of vegetation on the managed field lead to a phase of emissions until the oat plants started to grow in June. The uptake peak of the oat field is much later than that of the grassland, but larger due to a rapid plant growth. Budgeting the whole measurement period, the grassland served as a carbon sink, whereas the oat field was identified to be a carbon source. The conversion from non-used grasslands on peat soil to cultivated fields in Western Siberia is therefore considered to have a positive feedback on climate change.", (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The distinguishing feature of the MDDS is that the algorithm makes full use of sensitivity information in the optimization procedure. The Latin hypercube one-factor-at-a-time (LH-OAT) technique is used to calculate the sensitivity information of every parameter in the model. The performance of the MDDS is compared to that of the dynamically dimensioned search (DDS), the DDS identifying only the most sensitive parameters, and the shuffled complex evolution (SCE) method, respectively, for calibration of the easy distributed hydrological model (EasyDHM). The comparisons range from  to  model evaluations per optimization trial. The results show the following: the MDDS algorithm outperforms the DDS algorithm, the DDS algorithm identifying the most sensitive parameters, and the SCE algorithm within a specified maximum number of function evaluations (fewer than ); the MDDS algorithm shows robustness compared with the DDS algorithm when the maximum number of model evaluations is less than ; the advantages of the MDDS algorithm are more obvious for a high-dimensional distributed hydrological model, such as the EasyDHM model; and the optimization results from the MDDS algorithm are not very sensitive to either the variance (between . and ) for randn' used in the MDDS algorithm or the number of strata used in the Latin hypercube (LH) sampling.

Mixed contaminated soil was prepared by mixing clean soil with naphthalene, phenanthrene, lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd), and chromium (Cr). To study the biomass amendments, soil was amended with biochar, compost, or a nutrient solution. To study chemical amendments, plants raised in contaminated soils were amended with a solution of EDTA, Igepal CA- or both. The combination of biomass and chemical amendments were studied by treating composted soil with either EDTA or Igepal CA-. The results showed that the biochar and compost amendments improved the growth characteristics and biomass of the plants. Growth improvement was best observed for sunflower plants in composted soil. Average maximum plant height of sunflower in contaminated soil was increased by % with the addition of compost. Cd and Pb removal was best in the presence of biochar and compost amendments, but Cr removal was unaffected by the use of amendments. The best removal rate was observed for Pb by oat plant in compost amended soil, with average final Pb concentration decreased by .% with the addition of compost to soil. Nutrient solution amendment did not improve the removal of the metal contamination from the soil. The overall growth and biomass were less for plants grown in soil that was treated with chemical amendments. A combination of compost and chemical amendments also did not provide positive results on the plant growth or contaminant dissipation.

The unknown Robin coefficient is to be reconstructed with partial boundary measurements, including both Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions. Two different boundary value problems are introduced in such a way that two types of boundary measurements are coupled into a single Robin boundary condition, and the two BVPs depend on two different positive numbers alpha() and alpha(), respectively. By applying the Kohn-Vogelius approach with Tikhonov regularization, the boundary data fitting is recast into the whole domain data fitting, which makes the coefficient identification more stable. More importantly, a feasible reconstruction could be obtained even for very small regularization parameter through choosing the values of alpha() and alpha() properly.

In this study, a non-dimensional relative sensitivity coefficient was employed to predict responses of ETref to perturbations of four climatic variables in the Changjiang (Yangtze River) basin. ETref was estimated with the FAO- Penman-Monteith equation. A -year historical dataset of daily air temperature, wind speed, relative humidity and daily sunshine duration at  national meteorological observatory stations was used in the analysis. Results show that the response of ETref can be precisely predicted under perturbation of relative humidity or shortwave radiation by their sensitivity coefficients; the predictive power under perturbations of air temperature and wind speed depended on the magnitude of the perturbation, season and region. The prediction errors were much smaller than the seasonal and regional variation of their sensitivity coefficients. The sensitivity coefficient could also be used to predict the response of ETref to co-perturbation of several variables. The accuracy of the prediction increases from the lower to the upper region. Spatial variations of long-term average monthly and yearly sensitivity coefficients were obtained by interpolation of station estimates. In general, relative humidity was the most sensitive variable, followed by shortwave radiation, air temperature and wind speed. The actual rank of the four climatic variables in terms of their sensitivity varied with season and region. The large spatial variability of the sensitivity coefficients of all the climatic variables in the middle and tower regions of the basin was to a large extent determined by the distinct wind-speed patterns in those two regions.", (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

A pot experiment with wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), oat (A vena sativa L.), and redbeet (Beta vulgaris L.) was conducted to test the ability of limestone and hydrous ferric oxide (HFO) to ameliorate Ni phytotoxicity in two soils contaminated by particulate emissions from a nickel refinery. Quarry muck (Terric Haplohemist; % organic matter) contained  mg kg(-) of total Ni. The mineral soil, Welland silt loam (Typic Epiaquoll), was more contaminated ( mg Ni kg(-)). Both soils were very strongly acidic, allowing the soil Ni to be soluble and phytotoxic. Nickel phytotoxicity of the untreated muck soil was not very pronounced and could be easily confused with symptoms of Mn deficiency that occurred in this soil even with Mn fertilization. Severe nickel phytotoxicity of the untreated mineral soil prevented any growth of redbeet, the most sensitive crop; even wheat, a relatively Ni-resistant species, was severely damaged.

However, applying watershed models is time consuming and requires technical knowledge, including model selection and validation. The objective of this study is to assess two commonly used watershed models and their parameter sensitivity to reduce model loadings and to gain a better understanding of the model performances. The Hydrological Simulation Program-Fortran (HSPF) model and Storm Water Management Model (SWMM) were applied to a mostly forested Taiwanese reservoir watershed with pollution from tea plantations. Statistical analysis showed that both models are suitable for the studied watershed, but the performances of the flow and water quality simulations are different. The mean flow simulated by SWMM was lower than the experimental observations. The HSPF model performed better, possibly because the soil in the study area is highly permeable and the HSPF model has more precise soil layer calculations. SWMM may underestimate the total phosphorous (TP) and suspended solid (SS) loads following small storm events in highly permeable watersheds. The Latin Hypercube-One factor At a Time (LH-OAT) method was used to determine the parameter sensitivity of the HSPF model and SWMM. In both of the models, the parameters related to infiltration and soil characteristics strongly affected the flow simulation, except when using the Horton infiltration method in the SWMM.

Based on findings from the  A HN pandemic in the National Capital Region (NCR), this paper presents a recovery analysis for workforce disruptions using economic input-output modeling. The model formulation takes into consideration the dynamic interdependencies across sectors in an economic system in addition to the inherent characteristics of the economic sectors. From a macroeconomic perspective, the risk of the influenza disaster can be modeled using two risk metrics. First, there is the level of inoperability, which represents the percentage difference between the ideal production level and the degraded production level. Second, the economic loss metric represents the financial value associated with the reduced output. The contribution of this work revolves around the modeling of uncertainties triggered by new perturbations to interdependent economic sectors within an influenza pandemic timeline. We model the level of inoperability of economic sectors throughout their recovery horizon from the initial outbreak of the disaster using a dynamic model. Moreover, we use the level of inoperability values to quantify the cumulative economic losses incurred by the sectors within the recovery horizon. Finally, we revisit the  NCR pandemic scenario to demonstrate the use of uncertainty analysis in modeling the inoperability and economic loss behaviors due to time-varying perturbations and their associated ripple effects to interdependent economic sectors.",,"El Haimar, A|Santos, JR",NATURAL HAZARDS,pandemic disaster risk analysis new perturbation uncertainty modeling,10.1007/s11069-015-1637-6

Unless efficient algorithms are used, sensitivity analysis can be computationally expensive, and hence, limited in its efficacy. Traditional direct differentiation methods can be computationally expensive with complexity as large as O(n()+n() m()+nm()), where n is the number of generalized coordinates in the system and m is the number of algebraic constraints. In this paper, a direct differentiation divide-and-conquer approach is presented for efficient sensitivity analysis of multibody systems with general topologies. This approach uses a binary tree structure to traverse the topology of the system and recursively generate the sensitivity data in linear and logarithmic complexities for serial and parallel implementations, respectively. This method works concurrently with the forward dynamics problem, and hence, requires minimal data storage. The differentiation required in this algorithm is minimum as compared to traditional methods, and is generated locally on each body as a preprocessing step. The method provides sensitivity values accurately up to integration tolerance and is insensitive to perturbations in design parameter values. This approach is a good alternative to existing methodologies, as it is fairly simple to implement for general topologies and is computationally efficient.",,"Mukherjee, RM|Bhalerao, KD|Anderson, KS",STRUCTURAL AND MULTIDISCIPLINARY OPTIMIZATION,multibody dynamics systems sensitivity analysis direct differentiation divide- and-conquer formulation,10.1007/s00158-007-0142-2

However, the occupant behavior in buildings is not well understood and oversimplified. In addition, a majority of current researches just focused on the occupant number variation and ignored the temporal variation (e.g., the occupant presence duration and arrive/leave time). This paper aims to use a whole building simulation program (i.e., EnergyPlus) to investigate the impacts of spatio-temporal occupant behaviors on residential building energy usage utilizing a simple static schedule-based behavior model through uncertainty analysis (UA) and sensitivity analysis (SA). A residential prototype building EnergyPlus model with two thermal zones from the U.S. Department of Energy is used for the case study.

While a lot of progress has been made on using distributed data in simulations of hydrological models, sensitivity of spatial data with respect to model results is not well understood. In this paper we develop a spatial sensitivity analysis method for spatial input data (snow cover fraction - SCF) for a distributed rainfall-runoff model to investigate when the model is differently subjected to SCF uncertainty in different zones of the model. The analysis was focussed on the relation between the SCF sensitivity and the physical and spatial parameters and processes of a distributed rainfall-runoff model. The methodology is tested for the Biebrza River catchment, Poland, for which a distributed WetSpa model is set up to simulate  years of daily runoff. The sensitivity analysis uses the Latin-Hypercube One-factor-At-a-Time (LH-OAT) algorithm, which employs different response functions for each spatial parameter representing a  x  km snow zone. The results show that the spatial patterns of sensitivity can be easily interpreted by co-occurrence of different environmental factors such as geomorphology, soil texture, land use, precipitation and temperature. Moreover, the spatial pattern of sensitivity under different response functions is related to different spatial parameters and physical processes. The results clearly show that the LH-OAT algorithm is suitable for our spatial sensitivity analysis approach and that the SCF is spatially sensitive in the WetSpa model.

Firstly, the physico-biochemical processes are screened to obtain a preliminary assessment on the critical processes and to determine the processes that require more detailed comparison. Then, local sensitivity analysis is carried out to specify the sensitive parameters and processes. Results show that the hydrodynamic results, heat transfer rate and reaeration simulations cause large differences in model simulation outputs for water temperature and dissolved oxygen concentrations.

Sporadic evidence suggests that anthropogenic nitrogen (N) input may impact the development and the functioning of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi, potentially altering host plant growth and soil carbon (C) dynamics. In this study, we examined how mineral N inputs affected mycorrhizal mediation of plant N acquisition and residue decomposition in a microcosm system. Each microcosm unit was separated into HOST and TEST compartments by a replaceable mesh screen that either prevented or allowed AM fungal hyphae but not plant roots to grow into the TEST compartments. Wild oat (Avena fatua L.) was planted in the HOST compartments that had been inoculated with either a single species of AM fungus, Glomus etunicatum, or a mixture of AM fungi including G. etunicatum. Mycorrhizal contributions to plant N acquisition and residue decomposition were directly assessed by introducing a mineral N- tracer and C--rich residues of a C- plant to the TEST compartments. Results from N- tracer measurements showed that AM fungal hyphae directly transported N from the TEST soil to the host plant. Compared with the control with no penetration of AM fungal hyphae, AM hyphal penetration led to a % increase in biomass N- of host plants and a % reduction in extractable inorganic N in the TEST soil. Mineral N inputs to the HOST compartments (equivalent to . g N m(-) yr(-)) increased oat biomass and total root length colonized by mycorrhizal fungi by % and %, respectively, as compared with the no-N control. Mineral N inputs to the HOST plants also reduced extractable inorganic N and particulate residue C proportion by % and %, respectively, in the corresponding TEST soils as compared to the no-N control, by stimulating AM fungal growth and activities.

In cities, neighborhoods are often considered a homogenous and appropriate unit with which to assess heat risk. This manuscript presents results from a pilot study examining the variability of individually experienced temperatures (IETs) within a single urban neighborhood. In July ,  research participants were recruited from the South End neighborhood of Boston and equipped with Thermochron iButtons that measured the air temperatures surrounding individuals as they went about their daily lives. IETs were measured during a heat wave period (July -), which included  days with excessive heat warnings and  day with a heat advisory, as well as a reference period (July -) in which temperatures were below seasonal averages. IETs were not homogeneous during the heat wave period; mean IETs were significantly different between participants (p < .). The majority of participants recorded IETs significantly lower than outdoor ambient temperatures (OATs), and on average, the mean IET was . A degrees C below the mean OAT. Compared with IETs during the reference period, IETs during the heat wave period were . A degrees C higher. More than half of participants did not experience statistically different temperatures between the two test periods, despite the fact that the mean OAT was . A degrees C higher during the heat wave period. The IET data collected for this sample and study period suggest that () heterogeneity in individual heat exposure exists within this neighborhood and that () outdoor temperatures misrepresent the mean experienced temperatures during a heat wave period. Individual differences in attributes (gender, race, socioeconomic status, etc.), behaviors (schedules, preferences, lifestyle, etc.), and access to resources are overlooked determinants of heat exposure and should be better integrated with group- and neighborhood-level characteristics. Understanding IETs for the population at large may lead to innovative advances in heat-health intervention and mitigation strategies.",,"Kuras, ER|Hondula, DM|Brown-Saracino, J",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOMETEOROLOGY,urban heat island boston heat individually experienced temperatures neighborhood heterogeneity,10.1007/s00484-014-0946-x

The Tangjiashan landslide dam induced by the M-w = .  Wenchuan earthquake had impounded the largest lake in the earthquake affected area with an estimated volume of x() m(), and the potential catastrophic dam breach posed a serious threat to more than . million people in downstream towns and Mianyang city, located  km downstream. Chinese authorities had to evacuate parts of the city until the Tangjiashan landslide dam was artificially breached by a spillway, and the lake was drained. We propose an integrated approach to simulate the dam-breach floods for a number of possible scenarios, to evaluate the severity of the threat to Mianyang city. Firstly, the physically-based BREACH model was applied to predict the flood hydrographs at the dam location, which were calibrated with observational data of the flood resulting from the artificial breaching. The output hydrographs from this model were inputted into the -D--D SOBEK hydrodynamic model to simulate the spatial variations in flood parameters. The simulated flood hydrograph, peak discharge and peak arrival time at the downstream towns fit the observations. Thus this approach is capable of providing reliable predictions for the decision makers to determine the mitigation plans. The sensitivity analysis of the BREACH model input parameters reveals that the average grain size, the unit weight and porosity of the dam materials are the most sensitive parameters. The variability of the dam material properties causes a large uncertainty in the estimation of the peak flood discharge and peak arrival time, but has little influence on the flood inundation area and flood depth downstream. The effect of cascading breaches of smaller dams downstream of the Tangjiashan dam was insignificant, due to their rather small volumes, which were only % of the volume of the Tangjiashan lake. The construction of the spillway was proven to have played a crucial role in reducing the dam-breach flood, because all the other natural breach scenarios would have caused the flooding of the downstream towns and parts of Mianyang city. However, in retrospect improvements on the spillway design and the evacuation planning would have been possible. The dam-break flood risk will be better controlled by reducing the spillway channel gradient and the porosity of the coating of the channel bottom. The experience and lessons we learned from the Tangjiashan case will contribute to improving the hazard mitigation and risk management planning of similar events in future.",,"Fan, X|Tang, CX|van Westen, CJ|Alkema, D",NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES,,10.5194/nhess-12-3031-2012

The presence of foods contaminated with heavy metals in the human diet can cause health damages.

It helps to quantify the relevance of parameters, to estimate their individual contributions to prediction uncertainty, and to better direct further data acquisition. In this work, we propose a response surface method for global sensitivity analysis (based on the arbitrary polynomial chaos expansion, aPC). The key advantages of our proposed technique are: () aPC alleviates the computational burden associated with conventional global sensitivity analysis methods that require many evaluations of a simulation model; () the proposed method incorporates arbitrary independent probability densities or weighting functions for the investigated model parameters, thus generalizing several existing methods to reflect the expected relevance of parameters values within their allowable ranges; and () our framework allows to incorporate this information while requiring only a finite number of statistical moments for the investigated parameters. We generalize the polynomial-based computation of Sobol indices to arbitrary distributions, and suggest an associated complementary new sensitivity measure based on polynomial representation, which allows both univariate and multivariate global analysis. Compared to Sobol indices, our new weighted measure is absolute rather than relative, and converges faster with increasing order of expansion. We use analytical and hybrid analytical-numerical formulations that further improve computational efficiency. Altogether, we can conduct global sensitivity analysis at computational costs that are almost as low as those of local sensitivity analyses. We illustrate our approach for a D groundwater quality and human health risk problem in heterogeneous porous media. (C) ", Elsevier Ltd.

These models are often over-parameterized (more parameters than needed are included in these models). As a result, it is necessary to identify sensitive parameters when these models are applied to the simulations of specific water bodies. Sensitivity analysis has been widely used as an effective tool to undertake the task. In this study, a hybrid approach was developed through integrating the parameter perturbation method and the Morris method into a general SWQM-parameter sensitivity analysis framework. The approach was applied to Lake Maumelle in Arkansas with its hydrodynamics and water quality being simulated by the model CE-QUAL-W. The sensitivities of the  model parameters were firstly evaluated by the parameter perturbation method in the simulation of the variables including temperature, ammonium, nitrate-nitrite, dissolved oxygen, total phosphorus and chlorophyll a, and  of them were found sensitive. The sensitivities of the  parameters were further investigated using the Morris method. It was found that each output variable was strongly sensitive to a distinctive set of parameters. It is also observed that the highly sensitive parameters display nonlinear relationships with the model outputs or strong correlations with other parameters.

Concentrations of WEP in cover crops were larger than those in wheat residue and soil.

The purpose of this paper is to obtain a better strategy that would obtain an optimum design which is less sensitive to changes in uncertain parameters. The process of finding these optima is referred to as robust design optimization (RDO), in which improvement of the performance and reduction of its variability are sought, while maintaining the feasibility of the solution.

Simon sandstone at the FutureGen . site in Morgan County, Illinois. The simulations illustrate the recent modeling effort conducted to successfully obtain a Class VI permit under the Underground Injection Control Program of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The scCO() was injected into a highly stratified reservoir, distributed among four lateral wells. Results show that each of the multiple reservoir layers with low permeability traps a fraction of the scCO() beneath it so that the injected scCO() does not reach the top of the reservoir by the end of the simulation period. Hence, all of the injected scCO() is considered to be safely trapped by the stratified structure within the reservoir. A local sensitivity analysis (LSA) was conducted for injectivity and plume size at the end of the  year injection period. The LSA indicates that the imposed initial conditions and the hydraulic properties of the injection layer contribute the most to the sensitivity. Overall, the simulation outputs are very sensitive to only a small fraction of the inputs. However, the parameters that are important for controlling CO injectivity are not the same as those controlling the plume area. The three most sensitive inputs for injectivity are the horizontal permeability and the residual aqueous saturation of the injection layer, and the initial fracture-pressure gradient. For the plume area, the most sensitive inputs are the horizontal permeability of the injection layer and the residual aqueous saturation of the two adjacent layers above the injection layer. The advantages of requiring just a single set of simulation results, scalability to the proper parameter errors, and straightforward calculation of the composite sensitivities make the proposed analysis attractive for guiding site characterization, injection well design, estimating Area of Review uncertainty and, and monitoring network design.

A typical practice (incumbent system) used to protect the tanks from these risks include (i) coating the interior surface of the tank with a solvent-free epoxy (SFE) liner, and (ii) adding a biocide to the tank. Herein, we present a screening-level life-cycle assessment study to compare the environmental performance of a graphene oxide (GO)-epoxy (GOE) liner with the incumbent system. TRACI was used as an impact assessment tool to model the midpoint environmental impacts in ten categories: global warming potential (GWP, kg CO eq.); acidification potential (AP, kg SO eq.); potential human health damage impacts due to carcinogens (HH-CP, CTUh) and non-carcinogens (HH-NCP, CTUh); potential respiratory effects (REP, kg PM. eq.); eutrophication potential (EP, kg N eq.); ozone depletion potential (ODP kg CFC- eq.); ecotoxicity potential (ETXP, CTUe); smog formation potential (SFP kg O- eq.) and fossil fuel depletion potential (FFDP MJ surplus). The equivalent functional unit of the LCA study was designed to protect  m() of the interior surface (unalloyed steel sheet) of a   liter biodiesel tank against abiotic and biotic corrosion during its service life of  years. Overall, this LCA study highlights the improved environmental performance for the GOE liner compared to the incumbent system, whereby the GOE liner showed % lower impacts in ODP impact category, % smaller in REP, % smaller in AP, -% smaller in GWP and HH-CP, -% smaller in EP, SFP, and FFDP, and -% smaller ETXP and HH-NCP category results. The scenario analysis study revealed that these potential impacts change by less than % when the GOE liners are functionalized with silanized-GO nanosheets or GO-reinforced polyvinyl carbazole to improve the antimicrobial properties. The results from an uncertainty analysis indicated that the impacts for the incumbent system were more sensitive to changes in the key modeling parameters compared to that for the GOE liner system.",,"Chilkoor, G|Upadhyayula, VKK|Gadhamshetty, V|Koratkar, N|Tysklind, M",ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-PROCESSES & IMPACTS,,10.1039/c6em00552g

Alternatively, this same concept can also be used to calculate the sensitivity of the problem when, instead of a hole, a small inclusion is introduced at a point in the domain. In the present paper we apply the Topological-Shape Sensitivity Method to obtain the topological derivative of inclusion in two-dimensional linear elasticity, adopting the total potential energy as the cost function and the equilibrium equation as a constraint. For the sake of completeness, initially we present a brief description of the Topological-Shape Sensitivity Method. Then, we calculate the topological derivative for the problem under consideration in two steps: firstly we perform the shape derivative and next we calculate the limit when the perturbation vanishes using classical asymptotic analysis around a circular inclusion. In addition, we use this information as a descent direction in a topology design algorithm which allows to simultaneously remove and insert material.

It dried up in April  due to groundwater overexploitation. The groundwater system is complex, involving many nonlinear and uncertain factors. Artificial neural network (ANN) models are statistical techniques to study parameter nonlinear relationships of groundwater systems. However, ANN models offer little explanatory insight into the mechanisms of prediction models. Sensitivity analysis can overcome this shortcoming. In this study, a back-propagation neural network model was built based on the relationship between groundwater level and its sensitivity factors in Jinci Spring Basin; these sensitivity factors included precipitation, river seepage, mining drainage, groundwater withdrawals and lateral discharge to the associated Quaternary aquifer. All the sensitivity factors were analyzed with Garson's algorithm based on the connection weights of the neural network model. The concept of ""sensitivity range"" was proposed to describe the value range of the input variables to which the output variables are most sensitive.

Especially in sensitivity analysis, the closed character of the data is often ignored. To that end, we developed a method to assess the local sensitivity of a model output with resect to a compositional model input. We adapted the finite difference technique such that the different parts of the input are perturbed simultaneously while the closed character of the data is preserved. This method was applied to a hydrologic model and the sensitivity of the simulated soil moisture content to local changes in soil texture was assessed. Based on a high number of model runs, in which the soil texture was varied across the entire texture triangle, we identified zones of high sensitivity in the texture triangle. In such zones, the model output uncertainty induced by the discrepancy between the scale of measurement and the scale of model application, is advised to be reduced through additional data collection.

Bioinformatic analyses of  non redundant swine enriched metagenomic sequences indicated a preponderance of Bacteroidales-like regions predicted to encode metabolism-associated, cellular processes and information storage and processing. After challenged against fecal DNA extracted from different animal sources, four sequences from the clone libraries targeting two Bacteroidales- (genes - and -), a Clostridia- (gene -) as well as a Bacilli-like sequence (gene -), respectively, showed high specificity to swine feces based on PCR analysis. Host-specificity and host-sensitivity analysis confirmed that oligonucleotide primers and probes capable of annealing to select Bacteroidales-like sequences (- and -) exhibited high specificity (>%) in quantitative PCR assays with  fecal DNAs from non-target animal sources. The two assays also demonstrated broad distributions of corresponding genetic markers (>% positive) among  swine feces.

Understanding how different plant and animal residues affect soil C and N stocks in these systems goes beyond soil dynamics since these elements are crucial for the functioning of the soil-plant-atmosphere system. The objective of this research was to determine soil C and N fractions, stocks, budgets and the carbon management index as affected by nine years of ICL with grazing intensities under no-tillage conditions. The experiment established in May  in a Rhodic Hapludult (Oxisol) of southern Brazil was composed of black oat (Avena sativa) plus ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum) pasture in winter and soybean (Glycine max) crop in summer. Treatments were regulated by grazing pressures to maintain forage at , ,  and  cm high (G, G, G and G, respectively). Non-grazed (NG) treatment was the control. Changes in soil C and N stocks and fractions (particulate and mineral-associated) were assessed in the ninth year of the experiment. Moderate and light grazing intensities (G, G and G) resulted in similar increases in total organic C, particulate organic C, total N, and particulate organic N compared with NG treatment. Soil C additions ranged from . to . Mg ha(-) from NG to the other grazing treatments. The G led to a soil N loss of . Mg ha(-) due to soil organic matter degradation. The carbon management index (CMI) values, compared with native forest (NF) as a reference, indicated soil quality loss and degradation under high grazing intensity (G).

However, offline training of reduced order models (ROMs) can have prohibitively expensive memory and floating-point operation costs in high-performance computing applications, where memory per core is limited. To overcome this limitation for proper orthogonal decomposition, we propose a novel adaptive selection method for snapshots in time that limits offline training costs by selecting snapshots according an error control mechanism similar to that found in adaptive time-stepping ordinary differential equation solvers. The error estimator used in this work is related to theory bounding the approximation error in time of proper orthogonal decomposition-based ROMs, and memory usage is minimized by computing the singular value decomposition using a single-pass incremental algorithm. Results for a viscous Burgers' test problem demonstrate convergence in the limit as the algorithm error tolerances go to zero; in this limit, the full-order model is recovered to within discretization error. A parallel version of the resulting method can be used on supercomputers to generate proper orthogonal decomposition-based ROMs, or as a subroutine within hyperreduction algorithms that require taking snapshots in time, or within greedy algorithms for sampling parameter space."," Copyright (C) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Oxberry, GM|Kostova-Vassilevska, T|Arrighi, W|Chand, K",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUMERICAL METHODS IN ENGINEERING,proper orthogonal decomposition reduced order model snapshot incremental singular value decomposition,10.1002/nme.5283

After cover crop harvest, crop residue is applied on the ground to improve soil fertility and crop productivity. Little information is available about quantifying the contributions of cover crop application to soil total carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) contents in temperate Australia. Here, we selected eight cover crop treatments, including two legume crops (vetch and field pea), four non-legume crops (rye, wheat, Saia oat, and Indian mustard), a mixture of rye and vetch, and a nil-crop control in temperate Australia to calculate the contributions of cover crops (crop growth + residue decomposition) to soil C and N contents.

A new approach to the retrospective derivation of erosion-induced quantitative fluxes of carbon between soil and atmosphere is presented and applied. The approach is based on the premise that soil redistribution perturbs the carbon cycle by driving disequilibrium between soil carbon content and input. This perturbation is examined by establishing the difference between measured carbon inventories and the inventories that would be found if input and content were in dynamic equilibrium. The carbon inventory of a profile in dynamic equilibrium is simulated by allowing lateral and vertical redistribution of carbon but treating all other profile inputs as equal to outputs. Caesium- is used to derive rates of vertical and lateral soil redistribution. Both point and field-scale estimates of carbon exchange with the atmosphere are derived using the approach for a field subject to mechanized agricultural in the United Kingdom. Sensitivity analysis is undertaken and demonstrates that the approach is robust. The results indicate that, despite a % decline in the carbon content of the cultivation layer of the eroded part of the field, this area has acted as a net sink of  +/-  g C m(-) yr(-) over the last half century and that in the field as a whole, soil redistribution has driven a sink of  +/-  g C m(-) yr(-) ( +/-  g C m(-) yr(-) if all eroded carbon transported beyond the field boundary is lost to the atmosphere) over the same period. This is the first empirical evidence for, and quantification of, dynamic replacement of eroded carbon. The relatively modest field-scale net sink is more consistent with the identification of erosion and deposition as a carbon sink than a carbon source. There is a clear need to assemble larger databases with which to evaluate critically the carbon sequestration potential of erosion and deposition in a variety of conditions of agricultural management, climate, relief, and soil type. In any case, this study demonstrated that the operation of erosion and deposition processes within the boundaries of agricultural fields must be understood as a key driver of the net carbon cycle consequences of cultivating land.",,"Quine, TA|van Oost, K",GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY,carbon dynamics carbon sink catchment profile scale sequestration soil erosion tillage erosion,10.1111/j.1365-2486.2007.01457.x

As applied here, the sensitivity method neglects most aerosol and aqueous chemistry processes. Inclusion of second-order sensitivities is shown to enable accurate characterization of response to large perturbations in emissions. An index is introduced to characterize the nonlinearity of ozone response to NOx emitted from each source region. Nonlinearity is found to increase with the tonnage and emission density of the source region, Interactions among the impacts of emission sources are shown to lead to discrepancies between source contribution attributed to an ensemble of emitters and the sum of the contributions attributed to each component.

In this paper a theoretical model is developed for predicting the onset of the sheet-flow regime as shear stress increases. This model is based on a new variable P-b representing the proportion of grains on the bed that are entrained as bed load. The model yields the equation P-b=. theta G() in which G = - theta(c)/theta, theta = dimensionless bed-shear stress; and theta(c)= critical value of Oat which grains begin to move. The equation shows that theta(t), which is the value of theta at the onset of the sheet-flow regime and is assumed to occur when P-b = , is around . with the exact value controlled by theta(c). For example, when theta(c) = ., theta(t) = .. The theoretical model is verified by performing a nonlinear regression analysis on data from  flume experiments. Additional flume experiments with a high-speed video (HSV) system result in consistent values of theta for the onset of the sheet-flow regime, which support the theoretical model.

The simulator is a fast method for upscaling the hydraulic properties of heterogeneous soils and is an alternative to the conventional method where a system of partial differential equations is solved in a numerical grid. The pore space is regarded as a cubic network. Each node represents a pore network, the permeability of which is chosen randomly from a density distribution function. The macroheterogeneity of the large-scale network is quantified by the width of the node permeability distribution. The capillary pressure and relative permeability functions are obtained from either the quasistatic simulation of the displacement of water by oil in a pore-and-throat network or the inverse modeling of soil column flow tests by using the approximate multiflowpath model (MFPM). At each time step, the fluid saturation and pressure of each node are calculated, formulating mass balances at each node, accounting for capillary, viscous and gravity forces, solving the system of coupled and linear equations, calculating the instantaneous flow rates, and updating the local fluid saturations.

Sensitivity analysis revealed that the transient responses of the axial distribution of fluid saturation, total pressure drop across the network, and sample averaged (upscaled) relative permeability functions depend on the variability of permeability distribution, spatial correlations of permeability field, capillary number, and viscosity ratio.

One of the most popular species for whale watching is the humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae). The migratory corridors, feeding, resting and calving sites which are used for whale watching may be influenced by changing ocean currents and water temperatures. Here, we used an innovative approach addressing the emerging issue of climate change on the whale watch industry. This involved participatory modelling using key stakeholders for the whale watching industry to develop a systems conceptualisation model for evaluating the potential effects of climate change based on a case study from the east coast of Australia. This participatory approach allowed us to identify the causal linkages (including feedback pathways) between different ""Elements"" of the system within which the whale watching industry operates. It also allowed us to integrate multiple drivers covering socio-economic and environmental aspects including climate change (e.g. temperature), policy (e.g. number of boats), ecology (e.g. number of whales) and socio-economics (e.g. number of tourists) to evaluate the changes in the overall system. We then developed a Bayesian belief network model from the systems conceptualisation on which stakeholders identified a priority issue (Profitability). Stakeholders provided the structure and the quantification of this model, and a sensitivity analysis was carried out to help identify important intervention points for the industry. Overall, our research illustrates how such a modelling process can assist local tourism operators and authorities in making rational management decisions within a holistic or systems-based framework and its approach is applicable to other regions.",,"Meynecke, JO|Richards, R|Sahin, O",REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE,whale watching climate change adaptation stakeholder bayesian belief network,10.1007/s10113-016-1034-z

Consideration of the increasing environmental problems and the possible crisis of fossil fuel availability at record high prices dictate that some changes will need to occur sooner rather than later. The recent oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico is just another example of the environmental threats that fossil fuels pose. This paper is an attempt to explore various bio-resources such as corn, barley, oat, rice, wheat, sorghum, sugar, safflower, and coniferous and non-coniferous species for the production of biofuels (ethanol and biodiesel). In order to assess the potential production of biofuel, in this paper, countries are organized into three groups based on: (a) geographic areas; (b) economic development; and(c) lending types, as classified by the World Bank. First, the total fossil fuel energy consumption and supply and possible carbon emission from burning fossil fuel is projected for these three groups of countries. Second, the possibility of production of biofuel from grains and vegetative product is projected.

It has been shown that the lumped-parameter model can draw on an analogy between electrical circuits and fluid flow to provide a simple but effective method for modeling the human cardiovascular system. In order to build a patient-specific CV model, it is not practically feasible to estimate numerous model parameters (electrical and structural) from patient-specific data (measurements). However, estimation may be possible if optimal measurement locations are identified for important model parameters with complementary optimal time regions. Thus, sensitivity analysis can be used to identify important parameters as well as the optimal measurement locations and optimal time regions in the pressure and flow waves. In this study, we applied parametric local sensitivity analysis to a linear elastic lumped parameter model of the arm arteries (with and without anastomosis) to identify important electrical and structural parameters.

Based on their approach the evaporation models were ranked in five classes, respectively the Bowen ratio energy budget (BREB) approach, three energy-aerodynamic based methods, a mass transfer method, two temperature and five solar radiation-temperature approaches. State dependent parameter models were used to estimate the sensitivity indices of the different evaporation estimation methods at daily and monthly frequencies. A drastic reduction in the cost of the sensitivity analysis was obtained when coupled with efficient sampling methods, producing quasi-Monte Carlo sequences (Latin Hypercube samples). Analysis of the sensitivity indices (S-i,) revealed that the energy and advective parameters (Q(x) and Q(y)) in the Bowen ratio energy budget method most strongly affect evaporation estimates. The most sensitive parameters for the energy-aerodynamic methods (Penman, Priestley-Taylor and the deBruin-Keijman methods) are the change in heat storage (Q(x)) and solar radiation. For the other methods the most sensitive parameters were solar radiation, air temperature and vapour pressure, but with lower sensitivities. After investigation of the first and second-order sensitivity indices, it was found that the first-order sensitivity indices capture more than % of the total variance of the evaporation estimates. Interactions between input parameters were found limited with a maximum contribution to variance of less than .% for daily frequency and less than .% for the monthly frequency. Results indicated that many parameters in the  evaporation models could be fixed without appreciably affecting the output of these models. This helped to reduce the computational load of these models. The uncertainty results show that the Dalton group is subject to the highest error.

The structural geometry is implicitly represented with the level set method, which evolves an initial structural model towards an optimal configuration using an evolutionary structural optimisation approach. The boundary movements in the three-dimensional level set based optimisation method allow automatic hole nucleation through the intersection of two surfaces moving towards each other. This suggests that perturbing only the boundary can give rise to changes not only in shape, but also in topology. At each optimisation iteration, the Marching Cubes algorithm is used to extract the modified geometry (i.e. the zero level set contours) in the form of a triangular mesh. As the boundary element method is based on a boundary discretisation approach, the extracted geometry (in the form of a triangular mesh) can be directly analysed within it. However, some mesh smoothing is required; HC-Laplacian smoothing is a useful algorithm that overcomes the volumetric loss associated with simpler algorithms. This eliminates the need for an additional discretisation tool and provides a natural link between the implicitly represented geometry and its structural model throughout the optimisation process. A complete algorithm is proposed and tested for the boundary element and level set methods based topology optimisation in three-dimensions. Optimal geometries compare well against those in the literature for a range of benchmark examples. (C) ", Elsevier Ltd.

The challenging aspects of simulation-based MRDO are both algorithmic and computational, since the solution of a MRDO problem typically requires simulation-based multidisciplinary analyses (MDA), uncertainty quantification (UQ) and optimization. Herein, the identification of the optimal design is achieved by a variable-accuracy, metamodel-based optimization, following a multidisciplinary feasible (MDF) architecture. The approach encompasses a variable (i) density of the design of experiments for the metamodel training, (ii) sample size for the UQ analysis by quasi Monte Carlo simulation and (iii) tolerance for the multidisciplinary consistency in MDA. The focus is on two-way steady fluid-structure interaction problem, assessed by partitioned solvers for the hydrodynamic and the structural analysis. Two analytical test problems are shown, along with the design of a racing-sailboat keel fin subject to the stochastic variation of the yaw angle. The method is validated versus a standard MDF approach to MRDO, taken as a benchmark and solved by fully coupled MDA, fully converged UQ, without metamodels. The method is evaluated in terms of optimal design performances and number of simulations required to achieve the optimal solution. For the current application, the optimal configuration shows performances very close to the benchmark solution.

In particular there is a possibility that the flow contains a shock wave, whose location is determined solely by the initial condition. In this paper, we consider cases with uncertainty in this initial condition and use generalized polynomial chaos methods to study the steady-state solutions for stochastic initial conditions. Special interest is given to the statistics of the shock location. The polynomial chaos (PC) expansion modes are shown to be smooth functions of the spatial variable x, although each solution realization is discontinuous in the spatial variable x. When the variance of the initial condition is small, the probability density function of the shock location is computed with high accuracy. Otherwise, many terms are needed in the PC expansion to produce reasonable results due to the slow convergence of the PC expansion, caused by non-smoothness in random space.", (c) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Clover had the highest copper content (. mg Cu kg(-) DM). However, it was the amount of total biomass production that determined which species was most effective at overall copper removal per hectare. The winter crop rye produced significantly higher amounts of biomass ( kg DM ha(-)) and, therefore, removed significantly higher amounts of copper (, mg Cu ha-), despite less accumulation of copper in plant shoots. The maximum annual removal rate, a summation of best performing summer and winter crops, would be . kg Cu ha(-) y(-). Due to this low annual extraction efficiency, which is less than the  kg Cu ha(-) y(-) permitted for application, phytoextraction cannot be recommended as a general method of copper extraction from vineyards.

The Flamelet Generated Manifold (FGM) approach is employed to predict mixing and burning of the evaporating fuel droplets. A methodology to match the experimental inflow spray profiles is presented. The spray statistical time-averaged results show reasonable agreement with mean and RMS data. The Particle Size Distribution (PSD) shows a good match downstream of the nozzle exit and up to x/D = . At x/D =  and  the PSD is under-predicted for droplets with mean diameter D > m and over-predicted for the smaller size droplets. The simulations reasonably predict the reported mean flame structure and length. The effect of increasing the carrier velocity (ETF-ETF) or decreasing the liquid fuel injection mass flow rate (ETF-ETF) is found to result in a leaner, shorter flame and stronger spray-flow interactions. Higher tendency to local extinction is observed for ETF which is closer to blow-off compared to ETF and has higher scalar dissipation rates, higher range of Stokes number, and faster droplet response. The possible sources of LES-FGM deviations from the measurements are discussed and highlighted. In particular, the spray time-averaged statistical error contribution is quantified and the impact of the inflow uncertainty is studied. Sensitivity analysis to the pre-vaporized nozzle fuel mass fraction show that such small inflow perturbations (by +/- % for the ETF flame) have a strong impact on the flame structure, and the droplets' dynamics.

The analysis yielded vertical profiles of hydraulic conductivity, specific storage, and specific yield at observation well locations. The hydraulic parameter estimates are compared to results from prior pumping and single-well slug tests conducted at the site, as well as to estimates from particle size analyses of sediment collected from boreholes during well installation. The results are in general agreement with results from prior tests and are indicative of a sand and gravel aquifer.

Despite a substantial body of literature demonstrating links between cover crops and soil biology, an important component of soil health, research evaluating how specific cover crop species influence soil microbial communities remains limited. This study examined the effects of eight fall-sown cover crop species grown singly and in multispecies mixtures on microbial community structure and soil biological activity using phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) profiles and daily respiration rates, respectively. Fourteen cover crop treatments and a no cover crop control were established in August of  and  on adjacent fields in central Pennsylvania following spring oats (Avena saliva L.). Soil communities were sampled from bulk soil collected to a depth of  cm (. in) in fall and spring, approximately two and nine months after cover crop planting and prior to cover crop termination. In both fall and spring, cover crops led to an increase in total PLFA concentration relative to the arable weed community present in control plots (increases of . nmol g(-) and . nmol g(-) respectively). While there was a positive correlation between aboveground plant biomass (whether from arable weeds or cover crops) and total PLFA concentration, we also found that individual cover crop species favored particular microbial functional groups. Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi were more abundant beneath oat and cereal rye (Secale cereale L.) cover crops. Non-AM fungi were positively associated with hairy vetch (Vicia villosa L.). These cover crop-microbial group associations were present not only in monocultures, but also multispecies cover crop mixtures. Arable weed communities were associated with higher proportions of actinomycetes and Gram-positive bacteria. Soil biological activity varied by treatment and was positively correlated with both the size and composition (fungal:bacterial ratio) of the microbial community. This research establishes a clear link between cover crops, microbial communities, and soil health. We have shown that while cover crops generally promote microbial biomass and activity, there are species-specific cover crop effects on soil microbial community composition that ultimately influence soil biological activity. This discovery paves the way for intentional management of the soil microbiome to enhance soil health through cover crop selection.",,"Finney, DM|Buyer, JS|Kaye, JP",JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION,cover crops phospholipid fatty acid analysis soil biological activity soil health soil microbial communities,10.2489/jswc.72.4.361

This method uses a custom-built floating tripod that is released oil the inundated floodplain and tracked from shore by a robotic total station. Simultaneously, an acoustic Doppler Current profiler (ADCP) collects flow velocity profiles and water depth data. Roughness values are derived from two methods based on () run-averaged values of water depth, slope and flow velocity to compute the roughness based on the Chezy equation, assuming uniform flow, () the equation for one-dimensional free surface flow in a moving window. A sensitivity analysis using synthetic data proved that the median value of the roughness, derived using method , is independent of () the noise in water levels, Lip to  mm, () bottom surface slope, and () topographic undulations. The window size should be at least  in for a typical lowland river setup. Field measurements were carried Out On two floodplain sections with an average vegetation height of .

In Arnhem, a spatial pattern of roughness values was present, which might be related to fractional vegetation cover or vegetation density during the flood peak. D float tracking proved a flexible and detailed method for roughness determination in the absence of wave, and provided an unrestricted view front shore."," Copyright (c) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Straatsma, M",HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,hydrodynamic friction submerged vegetation robotic total station adcp in situ measurements instrumentation,10.1002/hyp.7147

MODFLOW was used to model the flow field, and RTD was employed to simulate the sequential decay reactions involving perchloroethene, trichloroethene, dichloroethene, and vinyl chloride (VC). Predictive simulations were completed for two conditions: natural attenuation alone and source excavation followed by natural attenuation. Results demonstrated the feasibility of site remediation for both conditions with the latter one occurring in a shorter time frame. A detailed sensitivity analysis was performed to assess the uncertainty in model predictions. The most sensitive model parameters (i.e., initial contaminant concentrations, reaction rate constants, and source release rates) were perturbed and combined to form a number of parameter sets for use in the predictive simulations. The maximum plume length, the maximum plume concentration, and the persistence time for the noncompliance plume area were assessed to identify the possible failure scenarios and the most likely future plume configuration. Results indicated that further VC plume expansion or migration beyond site boundaries is unlikely.",,"Ling, M|Rifai, HS",GROUND WATER MONITORING AND REMEDIATION,,10.1111/j.1745-6592.2006.00129.x

The measurements were performed at a reference irradiation position selected at  cm from the geometrical centre of the neutron source. The spectrometric system in use is based on a central spherical He- thermal neutron proportional counter. The response matrix of the present spectrometer has been taken to be similar to the original Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) (Braunschweig, Germany) BSS's response matrix, with a five bins per decade energy group structure, as there is no significant difference in the BSS's physical characteristics. Thereafter, the authors' BSS measurements were used together with MCNP results to unfold the neutron spectrum by means of MAXED and GRAVEL computer codes from the U.M.G. . package, developed at PTB. Besides, sensitivity analysis has been performed to test the consistency of the unfolding procedure. It reveals that no significant discrepancy was observed in the total neutron fluence and total ambient dose values following the perturbation of some pertinent unfolding parameters except for the case where a  bins energy structure was assumed for the guess spectrum. In this latter case, a  % difference was observed in the ambient dose equivalent compared with the reference case. Finally, a comparative study performed between different counting systems together with MCNP and predictive formulas results shows that they were globally satisfactory, highlighting thereby the relevance of the unfolding procedure and the reliability of the obtained results.",,"Mazrou, H|Allab, M",RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY,,10.1093/rpd/ncr487

The lysimeter-network SOILCan was installed as a part of TERENO between March and December  within the four observatories. It represents a long-term large-scale experiment to study the effects of climate and management changes in terrestrial ecosystems, with particular focus on the impact of these changes on water, energy and matter fluxes into groundwater and atmosphere. SOILCan primarily focuses on soil hydrology, the carbon and nutrient cycle and plant species diversity. Time series measurements of states and fluxes at high spatial and temporal resolution in the soil and biosphere are combined with remote sensing information for the development and calibration of process-based models simulating impacts of climate change in soil processes at field to regional scale. Within the framework of SOILCan,  fully automated lysimeter systems were installed at  highly equipped experimental field sites across the four TERENO observatories. Relevant state variables of grassland and arable ecosystems are monitored characterizing climate, hydrology and matter fluxes into the atmosphere and within the hydrosphere as well as plant species diversity. Lysimeters are either being operated at or near their original sampling location or were transferred within or between the four TERENO observatories thereby using temperature and rainfall gradients to mimic future climatic conditions (space for time), which allow measuring impacts of climate change on terrestrial ecosystems. The lysimeters are cultivated as grassland (intensive, extensive and non-used) or arable land, the latter with a standardized crop rotation of winter wheat-winter barley-winter rye-oat.

The model is based on a mathematical-mechanistic description of the release from a single granule of a coated CRF accounting for its complex and nonlinear nature. The large variation within populations of coated CRFs poses the need for a statistically based approach to integrate over the release from the individual granules within a given population for which the distribution and range of granule radii and coating thickness are known. The model was constructed and verified using experimentally determined parameters and release curves of polymer-coated CRI's. A sensitivity analysis indicated the importance of water permeability in controlling the lag period and that of solute permeability in governing the rate of linear release and the total duration of the release. Increasing the mean values of normally distributed granule radii or coating thickness, increases the lag period and the period of linear release. The variation of radii and coating thickness, within realistic ranges, affects the release only when the standard deviation is very large or when water permeability is reduced without affecting solute permeability. The model provides an effective tool for designing and improving agronomic and environmental effectiveness of polymer-coated CRFs.",,"Shaviv, A|Raban, S|Zaidel, E",ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY,,10.1021/es0205277

In the SDS experiments, cover crops were planted in Fv-infested soil, and plants were assessed for fresh biomass, root rot severity, foliar symptoms, and amount of Fv DNA in roots. Inoculated alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.), crimson clover (Trifolium incarnatum L.), red clover (Trifolium pratense L.), and pea (Pisum sativum L.) had more root necrosis than the noninoculated controls, and Fv DNA quantities in roots did not differ from those found in soybean roots. Inoculated alfalfa, corn (Zea mays L.), crimson clover, oat (Avena sativa L.), red clover, sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.), and turnip (Brassica rapa L.) plants had lower biomass compared to noninoculated controls, although corn, oat, and turnip had no root necrosis. Biomass reduction and root necrosis were not observed in inoculated hairy vetch (Vicia villosa Roth), false flax (Camelina sativa [L.] Crantz), millet (Pennisetum glaucum [L.] R.Br.), mustard (Brassica juncea L.), rye (Secale cereale L.), ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.), triticale (Triticale hexaploide Lart.), and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), and Fv DNA quantity in the roots of these species was lower than in soybean. These results suggest that the legume species tested are hosts of Fv whereas grasses and Brassicas spp. are nonhosts or poor hosts. In the SCN experiment, select leguminous and nonleguminous cover crop plants were grown in soil naturally infested with SCN, and the number of females formed per root after  days was determined. There were very few (zero to five) SCN females on the roots of multiple varieties of leguminous cover crop species studied. No females were recovered from the roots of any of the nonleguminous species studied, except for a single female on four plants from three different species. None of the cover crop plants studied were susceptible hosts for SCN. With the increasing interest in using cover crops as a soil conservation practice in corn-soybean production systems, it is important to understand how this practice would impact major soybean diseases. Knowing the impact that cover crops may have on SDS and SCN is important to help farmers make better decisions when planting cover crops in areas with history of these diseases.",,"Kobayashi-Leonel, R|Mueller, D|Harbach, C|Tylka, G|Leandro, L",JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION,cover crops soybean soybean cyst nematode sudden death syndrome,10.2489/jswc.72.6.575

Our objective was to assess the solubility and plant availability of P from various DMFs as a function of soil P status. Eight different DMFs were obtained from liquid swine (LSM) and dairy cattle (LDC) manures treated by natural decantation, anaerobic digestion, chemical flocculation, composting, or mechanical separation. The DMFs were compared with mineral P fertilizer in a pot experiment with oat (Avena sativa L.) grown in four soils with varied P-fixing capacities and P saturation levels. The DMFs were added at a rate of  mg P kg(-) soil and incubated  d before seeding. Soil water-extractable P (P-WT) at all water: soil extraction ratios (:, :, and :) was slightly higher when DMFs were derived from LDC rather than LSM. Soil P-WT at the : ratio was lower with anaerobically digested LSM. At the : extraction ratio, DMF P was less soluble than mineral P as P saturation in soils increased. In soils with a lower P-fixing capacity, DMF P appeared less water soluble than mineral P under :  and :  extraction ratios. Aft er  d of plant growth, DMFs produced yields comparable to mineral P fertilizer.

Currently, complete and periodical exclusions of grazing are commonly adopted for the restoration of these degraded grasslands. However, little is known about the effects of such land uses on nitrous oxide (NO) emission in this region. Using static chamber technique, we quantified annual NO emissions (from May  to September ) from four land uses: summergrazed grassland (SG), winter-grazed grassland (WG), ungrazed grassland since  (UG) and oat cropland (C). NO emissions occurred mainly after farmyard manure fertilization and during spring thaw periods. Annual NO fluxes from the SG, WG, UG and OC were ., ., . and . kg N ha- yr(-), respectively. The spring-thaw NO emissions from UG and OC dominated the annual emission and accounted for % and % of the annual fluxes, respectively. In contrast, the contributions of spring thaw fluxes to total annual NO emissions for SG and WG were only %. NO fluxes during spring thaw season were positively related to soil NH+ + NO- content accounting for % of NO flux variability across all land uses. Land use conversion from the native grassland to cropland increased NO flux both during growing and spring thaw seasons due to farmyard manure application.

Multiyear datasets from the semi-arid Colorado Agricultural Meteorological (CoAgMet) and humid Florida Automated Weather Network (FAWN) networks were evaluated using a local sensitivity analysis (LSA) method which calculated the total error range of each individual sensor, as well as Morris and eFAST global sensitivity analysis (GSA) methods which simultaneously evaluated the full accuracy range of each sensor. Sensitivity of inputs (i.e., temperature, humidity, wind speed, and solar radiation) generally had values within the same range for the FAWN network with solar radiation being the most influential input in the Summer, while sensitivity to wind speed for the CoAgMet network was much higher than the other inputs. Due to its simplicity and ease of application, LSA is suggested as a minimal screening method for evaluating input sensor sensitivity. GSA results were highly correlated with each other, but local sensitivity was poorly correlated to GSA methods regarding wind input in Colorado. Uncertainty analysis showed the current configuration of sensors in the CoAgMet network to have a higher range of ET values between % and % confidence intervals, as compared to the FAWN network. The eFAST GSA method was applied using a hypothetical set of ""best case"" sensors in both stations (i.e., sensors with the best accuracy between both sites), showing solar radiation to be the most influential input in the high ET months of summer, and the sensitivity in Colorado to wind to be vastly decreased, suggesting that the CoAgMet network could benefit from an upgrade to more accurate anemometers.", Published by Elsevier B.V.,"DeJonge, KC|Ahmadi, M|Ascough, JC|Kinzli, KD",COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE,evapotranspiration sensitivity analysis instrumentation sensor accuracy irrigation water,10.1016/j.compag.2014.11.013

The pesticides detected in water samples collected downstream greenhouses include  fungicides,  herbicides and  insecticides.  compounds from flower and vegetable productions were frequently found to exceed environmental risk levels, and with a few exceptions the compounds were found in higher concentrations than those typically found in agricultural runoff. Some compounds were found in high concentrations (> mu g/l) in undiluted runoff from greenhouses producing vegetables. Nutrient concentrations in the runoff were also sporadically very high, with phosphorous values varying between . and . mgP/l, and nitrogen values between . and . mgN/l. Undiluted runoff from the productions showed values of  mgP/l and  mgN/l. High values of pesticides correlated with high values of nutrients, especially P. Column experiments using a sandy agricultural soil and stock solutions of non-polar and slightly polar pesticides mixed with a complex binder and nutrients showed a significant reduction for nearly all of the compounds used, indicating that transport through soil will reduce the concentrations of the studied pesticides.

The present study with the crustacean Gammarus fossarum, a sentinel species in freshwater monitoring, combines a dual field and laboratory experimental approach with a population modeling framework. In this way, we developed an ecologically relevant periodic matrix population model for Gammarus. This model allowed us to capture the population dynamics in the field, and to understand the particular pattern of demographic sensitivities induced by Gamrnarus life-history phenology. The model we developed provided a robust population-level assessment of in situ-based effects measures recorded during a biomonitoring program on a French watershed impacted by past mining activities. Thus, our study illustrates the potential of population modeling when seeking to decipher the role of environmental toxic contamination in ecological perturbations.",,"Coulaud, R|Geffard, O|Coquillat, A|Queau, H|Charles, S|Chaumot, A",ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY,,10.1021/es501126g

To provide model-ready emission input, the NH emission inventory was gridded for the modeling domain at  x  km resolution using source-based spatial surrogates and a GIS system. The best estimate of total NH emission for the province was . kt in  with a percentage uncertainty of .%. Four major contributors were farmland ecosystem, livestock wastes, humans and waste treatment, which contributed .%, .%, .%, and .% of the total emissions, respectively. The averaged NH emission density for the whole region was . t km(-) yr(-) and the higher values were found in coastal areas with higher dense populations. The seasonal patterns, with higher emissions in summer, were consistent with the patterns of temperature and planting practices. From  to , annual NH emissions increased from . kt to . kt. All of these changes are insignificant compared to the estimated overall uncertainties in the analysis, but indicative of changes in the source categories over this period. Between  and , the largest changes occurred in human emissions and waste treatment plants, which were consistent with the process of rapid urbanization. Meanwhile, the decrease of emissions from pigs was slightly higher than the increased emissions from broilers and the increased emissions from meat goats and beef cattle due to the combine effects of increasingly stringent environmental requirements for pig farms and shift away from pork consumption to beef, chicken and mutton. The validity of the estimates was further evaluated using uncertainty analysis, comparison with previous studies, and correlation analysis between emission density and observed ground ammonia. The inventories reflect the changes in economic progress and environmental protection and can provide scientific basis for the establishment of effective PM. control strategies. (C) ", Elsevier Ltd.

Pot experiments with oat plants (Avena sativa) were conducted under greenhouse condition for  days. Plant biomass, physiological parameters in leaves, soil enzymes, and degradation rate of total petroleum hydrocarbon were measured. The result demonstrated that petroleum inhibited the growth of the plant; however, inoculation with PGPR in combination with AMF resulted in an increase in dry weight and stem height compared with noninoculated controls. Petroleum stress increased the accumulation ofmalondialdehyde (MDA) and free proline and the activities of the antioxidant enzyme such as superoxide dismutase, catalase, and peroxidase. Application of PGPR and AMF augmented the activities of three enzymes compared to their respective uninoculated controls, but decreased the MDA and free proline contents, indicating that PGPR and AMF could make the plants more tolerant to harmful hydrocarbon contaminants. It also improved the soil quality by increasing the activities of soil enzyme such as urease, sucrase, and dehydrogenase. In addition, the degradation rate of total petroleum hydrocarbon during treatment with PGPR and AMF in moderately contaminated soil reached a maximum of . %.

Feeding time decreases and time to return to feeding after feeding is abandoned and time it takes a group of dolphins to feed increase in the presence of boats. Such effects on feeding behavior may exert energetic costs on dolphins and thus reduce an individual's survival and reproductive capacity or maybe associated with shifts in distribution. We sought to predict which behavioral changes modify the activity pattern of dolphins the most. We modeled behavioral sequences of dusky dolphins with Markov chains. We calculated transition probabilities from one activity to another and arranged them in a stochastic matrix model. The proportion of time dolphins dedicated to a given activity (activity budget) and the time it took a dolphin to resume that activity after it had been abandoned (recurrence time) were calculated. We used a sensitivity analysis of Markov chains to calculate the sensitivity of the time budget and the activity-resumption time to changes in behavioral transition probabilities. Feeding-time budget was most sensitive to changes in the probability of dolphins switching from traveling to feeding behavior and of maintaining feeding behavior. Thus, an increase in these probabilities would be associated with the largest reduction in the time dedicated to feeding. A reduction in the probability of changing from traveling to feeding would also be associated with the largest increases in the time it takes dolphins to resume feeding. To approach dolphins when they are traveling would not affect behavior less because presence of the boat may keep dolphins from returning to feeding. Our results may help operators of dolphin-watching vessels minimize negative effects on dolphins.",,"Dans, SL|Degrati, M|Pedraza, SN|Crespo, EA",CONSERVATION BIOLOGY,activity budget dusky dolphins sensitivity analysis stochastic matrix models tourism analisis de sensibilidad delfines modelos matriciales estocasticos presupuesto de actividad turismo,10.1111/j.1523-1739.2012.01844.x

It is important to ensure that the mechanical components have an expected life with a high reliability. However, it is difficult to reduce the influence of factors that affect the fatigue reliability and thus a reliability sensitivity analysis is necessary. An approach of fatigue reliability sensitivity analysis of complex mechanical components under random excitation is presented. Firstly, load spectra are derived using a theoretical method. A design of experiment (DOE) is performed to study the stresses of dangerous points according to the change of design parameters of the mechanical component. By utilizing a Back-Propagation (BP) algorithm, the explicit function relation between stresses and design parameters is formulated and thus solves the problem of implicit limit state function. Based on the damage accumulation (DA) approach, the probability perturbation method, the fourth-moment method, the Edgeworth expansion is adopted to calculate the fatigue reliability and reliability-based sensitivity.

A novel targeting strategy is proposed in the context of four-dimensional variational data assimilation (D-Var) to account for nonlinear error growth as the forecast lead time increases. A quadratic error growth model is shown to maintain the accuracy in tracking the nonlinear evolution of initial condition perturbations, as compared to the first-order approximation. A second-order adjoint model is used to provide the derivative information that is necessary in the higher-order Taylor series approximation. The observation targeting approach relies on the dominant eigenvectors of the Hessian matrix associated with a specific forecast error aspect as an indicator of the directions of largest quadratic error growth.

In California's Sierra Nevada, climate change is likely to reduce water availability with warmer air temperatures and stationary or decreasing precipitation, which will likely alter whitewater recreation opportunities. In this study, we identified  whitewater runs on the west slope of the Sierra Nevada within a -basin study area that ranged from serene float trips to remote, difficult, kayak expeditions. We used a spatially explicit, one-dimensional rainfall-runoff model to estimate the unregulated hydrology at specific locations within flow thresholds amenable to whitewater recreation. Climate warming scenarios were simulated by increasing air temperature by  degrees C,  degrees C and  degrees C and assuming no change in precipitation. With mild warming, the average number of boatable weeks per year increases, but more extreme warming decreases the average boatable weeks per year across the Sierra Nevada. Runs in low-elevation drainages, such as the Cosumnes and the Tule River Basins, are most vulnerable to changes in boatable weeks. Yet, high-elevation watersheds, such as the Kern River, also have a large reduction in boatable weeks. Watersheds in the central Sierra Nevada show an increase in boatable weeks. Overall, we found elevation and run type to be the best predictors of resiliency for Sierra Nevada whitewater runs. Recreation is important for management of rivers, yet it is difficult to quantify and to plan for. This research provides a sensitivity analysis approach to climate warming for the Sierra Nevada and presents a method that can be applied to other regions and whitewater rivers. The observed reduction in whitewater recreation opportunities in unregulated rivers because of climate warming and continued increases in population will likely increase the importance of whitewater boating on regulated rivers and thus the reliance on operations for meeting multiple demands."," Copyright (c) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Ligare, ST|Viers, JH|Null, SE|Rheinheimer, DE|Mount, JF",RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS,climate change whitewater recreation boating sierra nevada,10.1002/rra.1522

Assessment of environmental threats and the potential phytoremediation of the soils require understanding of the toxic elements' uptake and distribution in plant parts. Hence, a greenhouse study was performed to examine the phytoavailability and distribution of Cr, Ni, Co, Cu, Zn, Cd, Pb, Hg, Se, V, and As in forage grasses: Oat (Avena sativa), Rhodes grass (Chloris gayana), Setaria (Setaria sphacelata), and the legumes Alfalfa (Medicago sativa) and Desmodium (Desmodium unicinatum). The average contents of Cr, Ni, Co, Cu, Zn, Pb, Hg, Se, and V in the plants were generally higher than the background levels for forage grasses/legumes, and some of these elements were in the phytotoxic range. Root bioconcentration factor (BCF = root to soil concentration ratio) >  was observed for Cu (Oat, Rhodes, Desmodium, and Setaria: Fluvisol), Zn (Setaria: Fluvisol), Cd (Rhodes: Fluvisol; Setaria from both soils) and Hg (Oat and Alfalfa: Fluvisol). Alfalfa and Desmodium displayed translocation factor >  (TF = shoot to root concentration ratio) for most heavy metals. Most heavy metals/metalloids may pose a health threat to humans and stock via introduction to the food chain. The plant factors (species and plant part), soil factors (soil type, soil fractions, pH, and CEC), and their interactions significantly (p < .) influenced plant heavy metal and metalloid levels. However, the role of plant part and species emerged as the most important on heavy metal uptake, translocation, sequestration, and ultimately transfer to the food chain.

Among the others, a Robust Satellite data analysis Technique (RST) was proposed (and applied to different satellite sensors in various geo-tectonic contexts) to discriminate anomalous signal transients possibly associated with earthquake occurrence from normal TIR signal fluctuations due to other possible causes (e.g. solar diurnal-annual cycle, meteorological conditions, changes in observational conditions, etc.). Variations in satellite view angle depending on satellite's passages (for polar satellites) and atmospheric water vapour fluctuations were recognized in the past as the main factors affecting the residual signal variability reducing the overall Signal-to-Noise (S/N) ratio and the potential of the RST-based approach in identifying seismically related thermal anomalies. In this paper we focus on both factors for the first time, applying the RST approach to geostationary satellites (which guarantees stable view angles) and using Land Surface Temperature (LST) data products (which are less affected by atmospheric water vapour variability) instead of just TIR radiances at the sensor. The first results, obtained in the case of the Abruzzo earthquake ( April , M-w similar to .) by analyzing  years of SEVIRI (Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager on board the geostationary Meteosat Second Generation satellite) LST products provided by EUMETSAT, seem to confirm the major sensitivity of the proposed approach in detecting perturbations of the Earth's thermal emission a few days before the main shock. The results achieved in terms of increased S/N ratio (in validation) and reduced ""false alarms"" rate (in confutation) are discussed comparing results obtained by applying RST to LST products with those achieved by applying an identical RST analysis (using the same MSG-SEVIRI - data-set) to the simple TIR radiances at the sensor.

Recently, significant progress has been made to quantify Fs from RS data, but both retrieval and interpretation of Fs remain challenging. In the case of airborne sensors with a medium spectral resolution (<- nm), Fs is typically estimated using the Fraunhofer Line Depth (FLD) approach focusing on atmospheric O- absorption bands. Most critical for accurate Fs retrievals based on such methods is the characterization of atmospheric scattering and absorption processes during data acquisition. So far, detailed experimental evidence on the retrieval accuracy of airborne measured Fs is lacking. We performed an experiment using a low-flying aircraft equipped with a non-imaging spectrometer acquiring medium spectral resolution data during the course of one day, using a repeat-track approach with changing flight altitudes. Fs in the near infrared was retrieved using a semi-empirical approach constraining the FLD based Fs retrieval from the O--A absorption band at  nm by using non-fluorescent surfaces. We used a-local sensitivity analysis to assess Fs retrieval biases related to observational and atmospheric parameters. Our results demonstrate a reliable Fs retrieval from airborne data using reference surfaces and indicate the need for accurate knowledge of atmospheric scattering and absorption processes. This study contributes to an estimation of the total error budget of Fs retrievals and will serve as a practical guideline for Fs retrieval schemes to be applied to medium resolution airborne spectroscopy data.", (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Sensitivity analysis of these models can be used, for example, to measure how uncertainty in the failure rates impact the reliability of the modeled system. The CTBN can be thought of as a type of factored Markov process that separates a system into a set of interdependent subsystems. The factorization allows CTBNs to model more complex systems than single Markov processes. However, the state-space of the CTBN is exponential in the number of subsystems. Therefore, existing methods for sensitivity analysis of Markov processes, when applied directly to the CTBN, become intractable. Sensitivity analysis of CTBNs, while borrowing from techniques for Markov processes, must be adapted to take advantage of the factored nature of the network if it is to remain feasible. To address this, we show how to extend the perturbation realization method for Markov processes to the CTBN. We show how to exploit the conditional independence structure of the CTBN to perform perturbation realization separately for different subnetworks, making the technique able to handle larger networks. This in turn allows the CTBN to model more complex systems while keeping sensitivity analysis of the model tractable.",,"Sturlaugson, L|Sheppard, JW",SIAM-ASA JOURNAL ON UNCERTAINTY QUANTIFICATION,continuous time bayesian networks sensitivity analysis perturbation realization reliability,10.1137/140953848

The methodology is based on Monte Carlo simulation, where relevant parameters on the rainfall-runoff processes of a hydrologic model were sampled from suitable probability distributions in order to analyse the probability distribution of output variables in a water resources system model. The procedure was applied to three water resources systems in the Duero basin (Spain). Results showed that the performances of the water resources systems are very sensitive to uncertainties in the model input. The deviation from the reliabilities or cumulated supply deficits obtained in the water resources systems compared to the reference inflows was much larger when the perturbations were unfavourable than when they were favourable. This suggests that the uncertainty analysis may have important implications when using these performance measures of the water resources system in decision making, particularly in dry years.

HYDROL-INF, an infiltration-runoff model for layered soils, is used for simulating infiltration and surface runoff. The predictive uncertainty related to the modeling is evaluated. Specifically, a three-step procedure is implemented for sensitivity analysis of the model. The first step involves application of the local sensitivity analysis to gain a qualitative ranking of the whole set of input parameters for different model outputs with a relatively low computational cost. In the second step, the first-order second moment (FOSM) method is used to obtain the most sensitive parameters to the output from the parameters identified by the local sensitivity analysis. Third, the robust and computationally efficient Fourier amplitude sensitivity test (FAST) is conducted to overcome the nonlinearity problem for estimating the uncertainty of the model. Furthermore, the proposed methodology is applied to a three-layer soil system with varying permeability under unsteady rainfall. The soil system consists of loamy sand, sandy loam, and clay loam. The model outputs considered herein include cumulative infiltration and runoff. Dissimilar lists of crucial parameters are identified by using the FOSM and FAST methods.

Uncertain model input parameters such as emission rates and reaction rate constants lead to uncertainty in model responses. However, traditional methods for characterizing parametric uncertainty are exceedingly computationally intensive. This paper presents methods for using high-order sensitivity coefficients in analytical equations to efficiently represent how the responsiveness of pollutants to emission reductions in the underlying photochemical model varies with simultaneous perturbations in multiple model input parameters. Separate approaches are introduced for characterizing the parametric uncertainty of pollutant response to a fixed or a variable amount of emission reduction. The approaches are demonstrated for an air pollution episode used in recent attainment planning in Georgia. For hypothetical scenarios in which domain-wide emission rates and photolysis rates are perturbed simultaneously by %, the reduced form models yield highly accurate predictions of the ozone impacts due to % reductions in nitrogen-oxide emissions in Atlanta (normalized mean bias .%, normalized mean error .%, R() = .) and inorganic particulate responses to Atlanta sulfur-dioxide emissions (-.% bias, .% error, R() = .).

If the optimization process is trapped at a local minimum due to the limitations of the gradient-based method, it generates equiprobable parameter fields using a geostatistical. conditional simulation. Among the generated fields, the optimization process selects one that enables the objective function to be reduced below the value of that at the local minimum, and then reactivates the gradient-based optimization. In generating equi-probable parameter fields, a constrained number of points (noted as releasing points) are randomly selected, and spatially correlated values are generated at the releasing points, conditioned to optimum parameters at the local minimum. By applying the stochastic optimization to synthetic permeability fields, it is observed that an inversed permeability field reproduces not only global distribution but also local spatial variability of the reference fields. In addition, the pressure distributions of the inversed and the reference field were much alike. To investigate dynamic properties of the inversed field and the reference field, streamline simulation was performed on both fields. Streamlines of the inversed field showed similar trajectories to those of the reference field, and time of flight (TOF) distribution of the inversed field was analogous to that of the reference field. The stochastic optimization technique proposed in this paper enables an inverse process to converge to a global minimum while preserving geostatistical properties such as mean, standard deviation, and variogram of an original field. Therefore, the stochastic optimization will be efficient in predicting future performance of a field from constrained number of permeability and pressure observation data.", (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

We used a combination of analytical and simulation-based analyses to examine  years of age- and sex-specific mortality data for southern sea otters (Enhydra lutris), and we applied results to project the efficacy of alternative conservation strategies. Population recovery of the southern sea otter has been slow (rate of population increase lambda = .) compared to other recovering populations (lambda = .-.), and the population declined (lambda = .) between  and . Age-based Leslie matrices were developed to explore explanations for the slow recovery and recent decline in the southern sea other population. An elasticity analysis was performed to predict effects of proportional changes in stage-specific reproductive or survival rates on the rate of population increase. A life-stage simulation analysis (LSA) was developed to evaluate the impact of changing age- and cause-specific mortality rates on lambda. The information used to develop these models was derived from death assemblage, pathology, and live population census data to examine the sensitivity of sea otter population growth to different sources of mortality (e.g., disease and starvation, direct human take [fisheries, gun shot, boat strike, oil pollution], mating trauma and intraspecific aggression, shark bites, and unknowns. We used resampling simulations to generate random combinations of vital rates for a large number of matrix replicates and drew on these to estimate potential effects of mortality sources on population growth (lambda).

It is shown that the projected gradient direction evaluated at a given Pareto optimum in the design variable space rigorously corresponds to the tangent direction of the Pareto curve/surface at that point in the objective space. This statement holds even for the change of the set of active constraints in the perturbed problem. Secondly, a new active constraint updating strategy is proposed, which permits the identification of the active constraint set change, to determine the influence of this change upon the differentiability of the Pareto curve and finally to compute directional derivatives in non-differentiable cases.

Its performance in a full -D Var setup with a limited area shallow water equations model is assessed by comparing with the adjoint model derived by the automatic differentiation approach (TAMC), where it is used for optimising the initial conditions. It is shown that the ISP sensitivity analysis provides a very simple approach of forming the adjoint code/gradients/differentiation of discrete forward models (even complex governing equations, discretization methods and non-linear parameterizations) and is realised using a graph colouring approach combined with a perturbation method. Importantly, the adjoint is automatically updated as the forward code continues to be developed. In the test cases, it is shown that the adjoint model using the ISP sensitivity analysis can achieve the accuracy of traditional adjoint models derived by the automatic differentiation method (TAMC) []. Further comparison shows that the CPU time required for running the adjoint model using the ISP sensitivity analysis is much less than that required for the automatic differentiation derived adjoint model since the ISP derived adjoint CPU time scales linearly with the problem size. The ISP sensitivity analysis is further applied to a highly non-linear Petrov-Galerkin FE model. The perturbation size used in deriving the tangent linear model with the ISP sensitivity analysis method is then optimised and the resulting approach used to assimilate both sparse (more realistic) and dense observational data for optimising the initial conditions. A simple first order formula is developed to calculate the perturbation size for each variable, at each node and time level. By applying the ISP sensitivity method to an intermediate complexity model (a shallow water model) this paper outlines steps towards applying the approach to data assimilation (DA) problems involving realistic complex models.

The severity of these environmental conditions places great stress on introduced and native pasture species and frequently results in poor establishment of new pastures using standard drilling techniques. The objective of this study was to determine effective, practical means of rehabilitating semiarid land (about  mm annual rainfall) on a site in Central Otago. A comparison of two direct drilling methods, a novel strip-seeder drill and a standard hoe-coulter drill, was conducted in a trial initiated during spring . Five drought-tolerant forage species were established: wheatgrass (Thinopyron intermedium), tall oat grass (Arrhenatherum elatius), birdsfoot trefoil (Lotus corniculatus), hairy dorycnium (Dorycnium hirsutum) and bluebush (Kochia prostrata). For the / growing season, species established with the strip-seeder drill had an overall mean herbage biomass of  g m(-), three-times that for the hoe-coulter drill ( g m(-), P < (.)). Differences in herbage biomass between species were observed, with hairy dorycnium (mean  g m(-)) producing significantly (P < (.)) more herbage biomass than the other species. After the third spring, the percentage ground cover recorded from transects across the strip-seeder drill plots (cf. the hoe-coulter drill) was: wheatgrass- percent ( percent); tall oat grass- percent ( percent); birdsfoot trefoil- percent ( percent); hairy dorycnium- percent ( percent); and bluebush- percent ( percent). The native plant content of the resident vegetation was reduced as a result of the drilling treatments and also when fertilizer was added to undistrubed pasture. The strip-seeder drill is capable of providing superior plant growth on dryland sites even during adverse drought conditions. It produces a furrow approximately  cm wider than the hoe-coulter drill, exerts a greater shattering effect on the soil structure and places fertilizer at depth. It is suggested that this assists plant establishment by providing good seedling protection from wind and sun, and subsequent plant growth by allowing easier root penetration to the subsoil where nutrients and moisture are available."," Copyright (C) 2004 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.","Wills, BJ|Trainor, KD|Littlejohn, RP",LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT,birdsfoot trefoil dryland drilling hairy dorycnium hoe-coulter drill strip-seeder drill rehabilitation tall oat grass wheatgrass new zealand,10.1002/ldr.626

Through a series of numerical experiments, the methods were compared across different time and size regimes to characterize the precision and accuracy associated with each method.

Drilling waste material was obtained from a well where a nitrate gypsum water based product was used to formulate the drilling fluid. The fluid and associated drill cuttings were used as the drilling waste source to conduct the experiment. The study was carried out in triplicate and involved five plant species, four drilling waste loading rates and a representative agricultural soil type in Alberta. Plant growth was monitored for a period of ten days. Drilling waste applied at times above the recommended loading rate improved the growth and germination rate of all plants excluding radish. Loading rates in excess of  and times had a deleterious effect on radish, corn and oat but not on alfalfa and barley. Germination rate decreased as waste loading rate increased. Effects on soil physical and chemical properties were more pronounced at the  and times exceeding recommended loading rate. Significant changes in soil parameters occurred at the higher rates in terms of increase in soil porosity, pH, EC, hydraulic conductivity, SAR and textural classification.

Here I calibrate and evaluate a risk algorithm for frit fly infestation in spring-sown oats, aiming to improve damage forecasts and assess the profitability of different control strategies with regard to regional infestation prevalence. Oat fields in two regions in Sweden with high and low frequencies of infestation were surveyed for  and  yr, respectively. The surveyed fields were classified either as infested or noninfested, depending on whether or not the infestation level exceeded the economic threshold. The relation between various risk factors and frit fly damage was examined by logistic regression, and risk points were assigned to significant factors. Regional action thresholds (risk point sums) resulting in the lowest average costs were calculated. In regions where pest outbreaks are common, a control strategy based on the proposed risk algorithm was more profitable than prophylactic or no sprays. The percentage of sprayed fields was reduced to < %, compared with routine use of pesticides. In low-risk regions, the profitability of the forecasting strategy and the no-control alternative were similar. The predictive accuracy of the risk algorithm was higher than that of a commonly used degree-day model, especially in regions where the frit fly is a minor pest. Based on these results, I suggest that use of the proposed risk algorithm can enhance the farmer's understanding of the biology of this insect pest, increase profitability, and reduce unnecessary use of pesticides. Long-term monitoring of pest and environmental data can facilitate not only on-farm pest control decisions, but can also provide essential information for developing regional pest control strategies.",,"Lindblad, M",ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS,"action threshold cost/benefit analysis frit fly logistic risk model oats, infestation oscinella frit pesticide use",10.1890/1051-0761(2001)011[1563:DAEOAL]2.0.CO;2

The reported new experimental uncertainties of the extinction strain rate include several sources of uncertainties that typically affect the characterisation of velocity and boundary conditions of counterflow flames via particle image velocimetry. The uncertainties associated with the numerical determination of the extinction strain rate not only depend upon the selected chemical kinetics parameters but also on the binary diffusion coefficients. In order to identify the major sources of uncertainties in the chemical and diffusion models, a Monte Carlo based high-dimensional model representation analysis of the extinction curve was performed. Independent and simultaneous perturbations of relevant chemical kinetics and diffusion parameters have shown that the uncertainties associated with the binary diffusion coefficients are about a factor of  smaller than the uncertainty due to chemical kinetics parameters. Since the experimentally well known binary diffusion coefficient for hydrogen and nitrogen, , accounts for most of the propagated uncertainty of the diffusion model, it is shown here that only a reduction of the uncertainty of chemical kinetics parameters will have a significant impact in improving the accuracy of the extinction strain rate predictions.",,"Esposito, G|Sarnacki, BG|Chelliah, HK",COMBUSTION THEORY AND MODELLING,uncertainty analysis extinction strain rate hydrogen diffusion coefficients chemical kinetics parameters,10.1080/13647830.2012.700406

A unified approach,MODEL OUTPUT INDEXES VARIABLES DESIGN LINK,"The present work is a sequel to a recent one published on this journal where the superiority of 'radial design' to compute the 'total sensitivity index' was ascertained. Both concepts belong to sensitivity analysis of model output. A radial design is the one whereby starting from a random point in the hyperspace of the input factors one step in turn is taken for each factor. The procedure is iterated a number of times with a different starting random point as to collect a sample of elementary shifts for each factor. The total sensitivity index is a powerful sensitivity measure which can be estimated based on such a sample. Given the similarity between the total sensitivity index and a screening test known as method of the elementary effects (or method of Morris), we test the radial design on this method. Both methods are best practices: the total sensitivity index in the class of the quantitative measures and the elementary effects in that of the screening methods. We find that the radial design is indeed superior even for the computation of the elementary effects method. This opens the door to a sensitivity analysis strategy whereby the analyst can start with a small number of points (screening-wise) and then - depending on the results - possibly increase the numeral of points up to compute a fully quantitative measure. Also of interest to practitioners is that a radial design is nothing else than an iterated 'One factor At a Time' (OAT) approach. OAT is a radial design of size one. While OAT is not a good practice, modelers in all domains keep using it for sensitivity analysis for reasons discussed elsewhere (Saltelli and Annoni, ) []. With the present approach modelers are offered a straightforward and economic upgrade of their OAT which maintain OATs appeal of having just one factor moved at each step.", Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier B.V.

A broad literature in this field concentrates on robust design of decisions (including robust optimization). This paper focuses on robustness testing, that is, checking whether a design has actually resulted in robust properties of the system if some of basic assumptions are changed. We propose a general framework of such robustness testing and show that robustness is a property of the relation between three (classes of) models: a basic model of the decision situation, a second model of possible perturbations of the first model, and a model of implementation of the decision, optionally taking into account some measurements of the impact of perturbations. Typical approaches to robustness or sensitivity analysis assume tacitly that the first two models can be combined and analyze parameters deviations in one combined model. However, the role of the first two models can be asymmetric if some optimization of the decision is performed on the first model. We extend this framework, intended originally for single criteria (scalar) optimization to multiple criteria (vector) optimization. The proposed approach is illustrated by diverse examples.",,"Wierzbicki, AP|Makowski, M|Granat, J",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY & DECISION MAKING,robustness sensitivity analysis multiple-criteria analysis,10.1142/S0219622015500157

A sensitivity analysis shows the % increase (at  atm and  K) in the OH + NO() -> HNO() reaction rate coefficient contributes to decreases in predicted ozone concentrations in our study domain. This revision to SAPRC results in the largest ozone change of all the rate coefficient changes we examined. Also, lumping species to achieve a more computationally efficient mechanism, with respect to SAPRC, has the effect of lowering ozone concentrations in the region studied. Although ozone concentrations in SAPRC simulations are decreased with respect to SAPRC, the NO(x) and VOC emission sensitivities of the new mechanism are on the same order or greater than those in SAPRC.

Corrections for atmospheric, adjacency, topography, and surface directional effects are applied sequentially and independently, accumulating errors into the TOC reflectance data, which are then further used in the inversion process. This paper presents a proof of concept for demonstrating the direct use of measured top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiance data to estimate forest biophysical and biochemical variables, by using a coupled canopy-atmosphere radiative transfer model. Advantages of this approach are that no atmospheric correction is needed and that atmospheric, adjacency, topography, and surface directional effects can be directly and more accurately included in the forward modelling. In the case study, we applied both TOC and TOA approaches to three Norway spruce stands in Eastern Czech Republic. We used the SLC soil-leaf-canopy model and the MODTRAN atmosphere model. For the TOA approach, the physical coupling between canopy and atmosphere was performed using a generic method based on the -stream radiative transfer theory which enables full use of the directional reflectance components provided by SLC. The method uses three runs of the atmosphere model for Lambertian surfaces, and thus avoids running the atmosphere model for each new simulation. We used local sensitivity analysis and singular value decomposition to determine which variables could be estimated, namely: canopy cover, fraction of bark, needle chlorophyll, and dry matter content. TOC and TOA approaches resulted in different sets of estimates, but had comparable performance. The TOC approach, however, was at its best potential because of the flatness and homogeneity of the area. On the contrary, the capacities of the TOA approach would be better exploited in heterogeneous rugged areas. We conclude that, having similar performance, the TOA approach should be preferred in situations where minimizing the pre-processing is important, such as in data assimilation and multi-sensor studies.", (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

To this aim, a methodology is presented providing detailed tracking of the treatment of PE input by two rainfall-runoff models. Since uncertainties affect both the structures and the inputs of rainfall-runoff models, the analysis is based on synthetic flow data. Standard synthetic streamflow series were generated using a standard PE input. Then, the PE series were corrupted successively by random and autocorrelated errors, and the propagation of these errors through the models' state variables is followed. For comparison, the same methodology was applied to rainfall data. The analysis is focused on two lumped rainfall-runoff models ( the GRJ model and a lumped version of TOPMODEL) over a large sample of  watersheds. The investigation shows that perturbation errors in the potential evapotranspiration are absorbed by the model's production ( soil moisture accounting) reservoir, which controls the water losses from the model. Given the slow variations in the soil moisture accounting reservoir, rainfall-runoff models behave like low-pass filters, absorbing high-frequency variations of PE inputs. In contrast, the models tested here do not smooth the rainfall perturbation.",,"Oudin, L|Andreassian, V|Perrin, C|Anctil, F",WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,temporal variability rainfall-runoff modeling potential evapotranspiration sensitivity analysis soil moisture input perturbation,10.1029/2004WR003291

When applying a physically based model on such a scale ( :   to  :  ), parameters with a high impact on the model result should be calibrated to account for (i) the spatial variability of parameter values, (ii) shortcomings of the selected model, (iii) uncertainties of laboratory tests and field measurements or (iv) parameters that cannot be derived experimentally or measured in the field (e.g. calibration constants). While systematic parameter calibration is a common task in hydrological modelling, this is rarely done using physically based slope stability models. In the present study a dynamic, physically based, coupled hydrological-geomechanical slope stability model is calibrated based on a limited number of laboratory tests and a detailed multitemporal shallow landslide inventory covering two landslide-triggering rainfall events in the Laternser valley, Vorarlberg (Austria). Sensitive parameters are identified based on a local one-at-a-time sensitivity analysis. These parameters (hydraulic conductivity, specific storage, angle of internal friction for effective stress, cohesion for effective stress) are systematically sampled and calibrated for a landslide-triggering rainfall event in August . The identified model ensemble, including  ""behavioural model runs"" with the highest portion of correctly predicted landslides and non-landslides, is then validated with another landslide-triggering rainfall event in May . The identified model ensemble correctly predicts the location and the supposed triggering timing of .% of the observed landslides triggered in August  and .% of the observed landslides triggered in May . Results of the model ensemble driven with raised precipitation input reveal a slight increase in areas potentially affected by slope failure.

Quantitative assessment of LULC impacts on runoff generations is vital for water resources development. The soil and water assessment tool (SWAT) model was used to study the effect of LULC change on streamflows. In addition to this, the present study proposed a newly developed flow-routing model called runoff coefficient routing model (RCRM). This new model is simple and requires limited data, such as precipitation, LULC and streamflows as compared to other models, which require meteorological and many more input data. The Nethravathi River basin was selected for testing the RCRM model with the SWAT model to study land use-land cover change on streamflows. The SWAT model and RCRM model have been calibrated for - and validated for - daily data. Results have shown that the simulated streams are well correlated with observed streamflows with a coefficient of correlation (R) equal to . in calibration and . in validation period. Whereas, the RCRM model results have shown R of . and . in the calibration and validation period. Finally, the SWAT and RCRM results were compared. It is observed that the results of the RCRM model have shown a good agreement with SWAT model results of R equal to . and ., respectively, in the calibration and validation period. The sensitivity analysis was also carried out based on Latin hypercube one factor-at-a-time (LH-OAT) method using the SWAT model and found  sensitive parameters out of  parameters.

However, in order to make conventional statistical statements regarding the scientific research, many expensive runs of the computer model are usually needed. New statistical theories, making their appearances, hold promise to alleviate the technical challenges. However, in cases where the underlying complex system is evolving with time, an effective theory for statistical analyses is lacking. In this paper, we propose a novel Bayesian methodology that extends the existing methodologies to the case of complex dynamic systems. The approach described in the paper exploits the recursive nature of dynamic simulation models to give a more efficient and accurate emulator. The motivating example, although not a real model for any physical process, may be thought of as a proxy for a model representing climate change, where it is of interest to predict, over time t, the four-dimensional proxy time series y(t) = (temperature, ice melting rate, barren land, CO emission). Also available are proxy observations on deforestation, recorded over time; hence treated as known. The latter is known as forcing input, denoted by z(t). The computer model is treated as a black box. Typically, Gaussian processes are used to model unknown computer models, which we adopt in our article. In order to exploit the recursive nature of dynamic computer models, we introduce a grid within the range of the unknown function where the entire dynamic sequence is expected to lie. This grid essentially defines a look-up table. Our proposed method then assumes that conditional on the response surface on the grid, and the available training data, the future responses are approximately independent. Exploiting the properties of Gaussian process, we justify our proposal theoretically and with ample simulation studies. We also apply our proposed methodology to the motivating example.",,"Bhattacharya, S",BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,gaussian process latin hypercube sampling markov property matrix normal parallel computing spatial interpolation,10.1214/07-BA232

In consideration of varying wet surface, the three DOFs nonlinear coupled equations are established for the spar platform under the effect of the first-order wave loads in the heave and pitch, and vortexinduced loads in the roll. By utilizing the method of multi-scales when the vortex-induced frequency is close to the natural roll frequency, the first-order perturbation solution is obtained analytically and further validated by the numerical integration. Sensitivity analysis is performed to understand the influence of the damping and the internal detuning parameter. Two cases with internal resonance are shown. The first case is that no saturation phenomenon exists under small vortex-induced loads. The first order perturbation solution illustrates that only the vortex-induced frequency motion in roll and the super-harmonic frequency motion in heave are excited. The second case is that the vortex-induced loads are large enough to excite the pitch and a saturation phenomenon in the heave mode follows. The results show that there is no steady response occurrence for some cases.

Here, we integrated a simple drain flbw component into HERMES. We then compared the predictions to four years of data (-) from central Iowa fields in corn-oybean with winter rye as a cover crop (CC) and without winter rye (NCC). We also compared the HERMES predictions to the more complex Root Zone Water Quality Model (RZWQM) predictions for the same dataset. The average annual observed and simulated N loss to drain flow were . and . kg N/ha (NCC) and . and . kg N/ha (CC). The slightly over predicted N loss for CC was because of over predicted nitrate concentration, which may be partly caused by slightly under predicted average annual rye shoot N (observed and simulated values were . and . kg N/ha). Also, recent research from the site suggests that the soil field capacity may be greater in CC while we used the same soil parameters for both treatments. A local sensitivity analysis suggests that increased field capacity affects HERMES simulations, which includes reduced drain flow nitrate concentrations, increased denitrification, and reduced drain flow volume. HERMES-simulated cumulative monthly drain flow and annual drain flow were reasonable compared to field data and HERMES performance was comparable to other published drainage model tests. Unlike the RZWQM simulations, however, the modified HERMES did riot accurately simulate the year to year variability in nitrate concentration difference between NCC and CC, possibly due in part to the lack of partial mixing and displacement of the soil solution.

The grass pollen season itself is special since it is caused by the flowering of various grass species that present unique profiles of allergenicity, which assumingly plays a significant role and impact on grass pollen sensitization profiles for the allergy sufferer. The aim of this study, conducted in Vienna, , was to analyze the possible contribution of prevalent grass species to the grass pollen season and to the symptom load of grass allergy sufferers. Methods: This was the first study that combines phenological observations (i.e. grass species and their flowering periods) with aerobiological measurements (i.e. daily grass pollen concentrations) in concert with allergic symptoms from local users of the Patient's Hayfever Diary (symptom load index calculation). Results: Both the pollen concentrations and the symptom levels were higher in the first half of the main grass pollen season and therefore show the highest impact on pollen allergy sufferers. Of important note were the following species that are widely distributed in Vienna: Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis), orchard grass (Dactylis glomerata), false oat-grass (Arrhenatherum elatius), fescue grass (Festuca sp.) and perennial rye-grass (Lolium perenne).

For in situ stress-released drillcores of quartz-monzodiorite composition from the Aspo HRL, Sweden, tracer mass balance considerations and D and D diffusion modelling consistently indicated a contamination of <% of the original pore water. This chemically disturbed zone extends to a maximum of . mm into the drillcore (. mm x . mm) corresponding to about .% of the total pore volume (. vol.%). In contrast, the combined effects of stress release and the drilling process, which have influenced granodioritic drillcore material from  m below surface at Forsmark.

Deterministic models do not account for uncertainties in model parameters, and thus lead to doubtful output. The main alternatives for deterministic models are the probabilistic models and perturbation methods such as Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS). Unfortunately, these methods have many drawbacks when applied in risk analysis of groundwater pollution. In this paper, a modified Latin Hypercube Sampling method is presented and used for risk, uncertainty, and sensitivity analysis of groundwater pollution. The obtained results were compared with other sampling methods. Results of the proposed method have shown that it can predict the groundwater contamination risk for all values of probability better than other methods, maintaining the accuracy of mean estimation.

This paper tests the utility of three derivative-free optimization algorithms (stochastic Gaussian search direction (SGSD), new unconstrained optimization algorithm (NEWUOA), and quadratic interpolation model-based algorithm guided by approximate gradient (QIM-AG)) for history matching. The SGSD method uses a negative stochastic gradient which is obtained by simultaneously perturbing all the model parameters using a Gaussian random vector. For a continuous objective function and a sufficiently small perturbation size, the stochastic gradient is always uphill and the expectation of the stochastic gradient converges to the true gradient as the perturbation size goes to zero. NEWUOA is a quadratic interpolation model-based optimization algorithm. At each iteration, the objective function is first approximated by a quadratic interpolation model. The quadratic model is then minimized to obtain an updated reservoir description for the next iteration. The number of interpolation points (reservoir simulation runs) required by NEWUOA must be larger than the dimension of reservoir model parameter space in order to construct the initial quadratic model. QIM-AG reduces the required number of interpolation points by replacing the first-order coefficients that appear in the quadratic model by an approximate gradient. The approximate gradient used in this study is an average of several stochastic gradients from SGSD. To reduce the dimension of the optimization problem, a simple parameterization method based on the prior covariance matrix is applied. The prior covariance matrix is approximated using an ensemble of unconditional realizations. The parameterization avoids the calculation of the inverse of the prior covariance matrix during optimization and may further regularize the ill-posed inverse problem.",,"Zhao, H|Li, GM|Reynolds, AC|Yao, J",COMPUTATIONAL GEOSCIENCES,sgsd newuoa parameterization history matching uncertainty quantification,10.1007/s10596-012-9320-4

Copper because its total volume in use in society is large and because of corrosion from water pipes it is most difficult to reduce the Cu concentrations in sludge. Fresh digested sewage sludge was spiked with Cu or Sb and the sludge was cultivated with oat ( Avena sativa), lettuce (Lactuca sativa) or radish (Raphanus sativus). Elutriates from the cultivated sludge were tested for toxicity with Lemna minor (-d growth) and Daphnia magna (  h immobility). Before cultivation the elutriates were toxic to Lemna and Daphnia due to high concentrations of ammonia (NH) and nitrite (NO-). Cultivation decreased the concentrations of both NH and NO-, thereby reducing the impact of these compounds in the toxicity tests. Cultivation also decreased the metal concentrations and pH.

For this, the sensitivity of the water depth to the friction coefficient is analytically derived for one-dimensional steady flow conditions in a wide rectangular channel. Also, the parameter of influence distance is defined to calibrate a channel reach using stage measurement at a given location. This characteristic distance allows % of the maximum possible variation in the sensitivity of the water depth to the friction coefficient to be captured.

However, general models, which can be easily adapted to other sites, remain few, in addition, they are simple and associated with significant uncertainties. In this paper, an approach is introduced for an ecological risk assessment ( ERA) model that can be modified for site-specific conditions. Using computer simulation as a screening tool for ecological risk assessment can assist environmental managers and policy decision-makers in the planning and implementation of potentially highly focused assessments and remediation, should the ERA dictate the need. The model was integrated with a Windows-based interface and interactive database management system (DBMS) as a user-friendly software package. In addition, based on trophic sources, a food web has been integrated into the framework of the DBMS. In an effort to evaluate the model, a case study was implemented to characterize the effects on an ecosystem of replacing electroplated chromium coatings with sputtered tantalum at U. S. Army Yuma and Aberdeen Proving Grounds. Potential exposure pathways included ingestion, inhalation, and dermal absorption for terrestrial animals; root and foliar uptake for plants; and direct absorption for aquatic species. Overall, results showed that the most significant exposure resulted from molybdenum and hexavalent chromium, which posed higher risks to select aquatic and terrestrial species at both sites. On the other hand, tantalum ( with vanadium as the surrogate) resulted in the least risk to all receptors within the studied areas. A sensitivity analysis demonstrated that soil-water distribution coefficients have a significant impact on the results. Based on the results, neither molybdenum nor chromium are recommended as a coating in gun barrels, and further study would be essential to address any affected firing range area. Tantalum is recommended for use, although for those species receiving a slight adverse risk, field investigations that include receptor sampling maybe necessary once soil/sediment and water sampling validates projected concentrations.",,"Lu, HY|Axe, L|Tyson, TA",ENVIRONMENTAL MODELING & ASSESSMENT,ecological risk assessment exposure model heavy metals food web,10.1023/B:ENMO.0000004585.85305.3d

In particular, the length of time over which the tangent-linear dynamics dominate the total evolution of a particle number concentration perturbation is determined. In the experiments, three non-linear model initial number concentration distributions, perturbation distributions, and ambient vapour concentrations are used. Results indicate, based on analysis of the evolution of number distribution perturbation, that in pure nucleation events the tangent-linear regime persists for about . h, and can last for several hours in cases of weak nucleation. Analysis of the perturbation evolution with emphasis on particle surface area or volume indicates that the dynamics is tangent-linear over a much longer period. In conclusion, high ambient sulphuric acid vapour concentration maintains a large number concentration of small particles (below about  nm) through nucleation. These particles are the prime source of non-linearity limiting the length of the tangent-linear regime in a box model context.

By reviewing the academic literature on SA, we here present a bibliometric analysis of the trends of different SA practices in last decade. The review has been conducted both on some top ranking journals (Nature and Science) and through an extended analysis in the Elsevier's Scopus database of scientific publications. After correcting for the global growth in publications, the amount of papers performing a generic SA has notably increased over the last decade. Even if OAT is still the most largely used technique in SA, there is a clear increase in the use of GSA with preference respectively for regression and variance-based techniques. Even after adjusting for the growth of publications in the sole modelling field, to which SA and GSA normally apply, the trend is confirmed. Data about regions of origin and discipline are also briefly discussed.

The approach adopts the point of view that the finite-element grid is fixed during the sensitivity analysis; therefore it is referred to as a 'Fixed Basis Function Shape Sensitivity' finite-element analysis. This approach avoids the requirement of explicit or approximate differentiation of finite-element matrices and vectors and the difficulty or errors resulting from such calculations. Effectively, the sensitivity to boundary shape change is determined exactly; thus the accuracy of the solution sensitivity is dictated by the accuracy of the finite-element analysis. The sensitivity analysis is undertaken within the context of Rayleigh's principle and is developed in quite general terms. It is shown that the evaluation of sensitivity matrices involves only modest calculations beyond those for the finite-element analysis of the reference problem; certain boundary integrals on the reference location of the moving boundary are required. In addition, boundary reaction forces and sensitivity boundary conditions must be evaluated. The present formulation separates solution sensitivity from finite-element grid sensitivity and provides a unique representation of boundary perturbations within the context of isoparametric finite-element formulations. The work is illustrated for beam as well as plate problems. Excellent agreement is obtained for shape-sensitivity calculations that compare exact solutions, fixed-basis finite-element results, and overall finite-difference approximations to the finite-element sensitivity results. It is illustrated that the finite-element eigenvalue problem and the fixed-basis finite-element eigenvalue-sensitivity results exhibit similar accuracy and convergence characteristics.",,"Hansen, JS|Lund, E",STRUCTURAL AND MULTIDISCIPLINARY OPTIMIZATION,shape sensitivity fixed basis function finite elements,10.1007/s00158-003-0287-6

Then, they are used for field generations in the gradual deformation method.

Hence the summary statistics ultimately compared to environmental standards are uncertain. Quantifying this uncertainty is crucial for robust water quality assessment and possible remediation, but requires strong assumptions. This paper compares three ways to model the missing data needed to fully characterise a frequency distribution in a Bayesian framework using multi-year/multi-location orthophosphate (arithmetic mean standard), dissolved oxygen (DO; th percentile standard) and ammonia (th percentile standard) data from the Tamar catchment in Southwest England. First, fitting an assumed parametric model of the frequency distribution (lognormal or Weibull), there is appreciable uncertainty around the ""best"" model fit. Second, Bayesian Model Averaging is more general in accommodating cases where the data are ambiguous with regard to the best model, but does not take into account possibly missing data. Third, a quasi-nonparametric multinomial model of the monitoring process that places some weight on those missing data yields wider and heavier-tailed frequency distributions. One-at-a-time sensitivity analysis suggests that the multinomial model for mean orthophosphate is sensitive to the choice of support range and the prior weights given to the missing data. Sensitivity is lower for th percentile DO and th percentile ammonia. The resultant probability densities of ecological status under the EU Water Framework Directive span several status classes, meaning ecological status is more uncertain than previously acknowledged. For orthophosphate, the regulatory, empirical determination of ecological status is not only overly precise but also biased.

We analyzed the yield of three oat varieties under different environmental conditions and created a model of factors significantly correlated with yield. Stepwise regression models were constructed for each oat variety, and the potential yield distributions were calculated for each variety. Correlating oat variety yield with environmental factors showed that precipitation and soil nutrition content were the most important factors in oat production. Precipitation and soil nutrition during the month of April were positively correlated with yield, while temperature and wind speed in July were negatively correlated with yield. The common oat variety ""Qingyj'' was capable of producing a fresh grass yield of , kg/hm() in western Sichuan, the southwest of Gansu, and certain parts of Qinghai and Heilongjiang province. The naked oat varieties ""Bayou'' and ""Pin'' produced high yields of  kg/hm() in Heilongjiang, the regions north of Shanxi, east of Neimenggu and the southern Gansu province, areas with high quality rain and soil nutrition conditions. We constructed a ""China Crop Mapping Decision System'' based on our findings, and this system is accessible through the internet and will facilitate informed agricultural decision-making.

The pore space is divided into three different regions, namely, bulk, diffusion and potential regions, based on the dominant processes acting in each of these regions. In the bulk region, colloid transport is governed by advection and diffusion whereas in the diffusion region, colloid mobility due to diffusion is retarded by hydrodynamic wall effects. Colloid-collector interaction forces dominate the transport in the potential region where colloid deposition occurs. The governing equations are non-dimensionalized and solved numerically. A sensitivity analysis indicates that the virus-sized colloid transport and deposition is significantly affected by various pore-scale parameters such as the surface potentials on colloid and collector, ionic strength of the solution, flow velocity, pore size and colloid size. The adsorbed concentration and hence, the favorability of the surface for adsorption increases with: (i) decreasing magnitude and ratio of surface potentials on colloid and collector, (ii) increasing ionic strength and (iii) increasing pore radius. The adsorbed concentration increases with increasing Pe, reaching a maximum value at Pe = . and then decreases thereafter. Also, the colloid size significantly affects particle deposition with the adsorbed concentration increasing with increasing particle radius, reaching a maximum value at a particle radius of  nm and then decreasing with increasing radius. System hydrodynamics is found to have a greater effect on larger particles than on smaller ones. The secondary minimum contribution to particle deposition has been found to increase as the favorability of the surface for adsorption decreases. The sensitivity of the model to a given parameter will be high if the conditions are favorable for adsorption. The results agree qualitatively with the column-scale experimental observations available in the literature. The current model forms the building block in upscaling colloid transport from pore scale to Darcy scale using Pore-Network Modeling.", (C) 2014 Elsevier By.

NPEOs are easily biodegraded in the environment, but the last end product, nonylphenol (NP), is the most toxic and recalcitrant form and hence can have a longer half-life in the environment. Despite the fact that most NP is finally degraded, a small fraction may remain in soil for longer periods. In soils, the application of sewage sludge is the main source of NPEOs. The aim of this study is to provide data on the effects of NP on a simplified soil invertebrate community since only a few studies using single-species bioassays are available for terrestrial ecosystems in comparison with aquatic ecosystems. In our study, we assessed the effect of increasing NP concentrations (, , , , and  mg NP kg(-)) in soil microcosms containing a simplified soil community consisting of natural microorganisms, a primary producer (an oat seedling of Avena sativa), several consumers (the isopod Porcellionides sexfasciatus, the enchytraeid Enchytraeus crypticus, and the collembolans Folsomia candida, Ceratophysella (Hypogastrura) denticulata, and Proisotoma minuta), and a predator species (the mite Hypoaspis aculeifer). The effects on the different taxa of the different NP concentrations were assessed over three sampling dates (, , and  days) using the principal response curves method. The soil community did not change significantly at concentrations below  mg NP kg(-), which was selected as the nonobserved effect concentration (NOEC). The highest concentration ( mg NP kg(-)) changed the community significantly after  and  days, but this effect disappeared after  days, in accordance with the known rapid biodegradation of this compound in soil. Taking into account the usual NP concentrations in soils with repeated applications of sludge, the environmental risk of NP to soils seems to be limited because the derived NOEC was clearly above the usual concentrations in soil reported in the literature. However, the use of highly polluted sludges or accidental spillages, together with the possible pollution exportation by runoff to aquatic ecosystems, which are highly sensitive to NP pollution, recommend the careful monitoring of this chemical in the environment.",,"Domene, X|Chelinho, S|Sousa, JP",JOURNAL OF SOILS AND SEDIMENTS,4-nonylphenol ecotoxicity invertebrate community microcosms,10.1007/s11368-009-0167-9

The original catalyst design mimics the microbial ClO- reductase, which integrates Mo(MGD)() complex (MGD = molybdopterin guanine dinucleotide) for oxygen atom transfer (OAT). Perchlorate reducing microorganisms employ a separate enzyme, chlorite dismutase, to prevent accumulation of the destructive ClO- intermediate. The structural intricacy of MGD ligand and the two-enzyme mechanism for microbial ClO- reduction inspired us to improve catalyst stability by rationally tuning Re ligand structure and adding a ClOx- scavenger. Two new Re complexes, Re(O)(htz)()Cl and Re(O)(hoz)(htz)Cl (htz = thiazolinylphenolato bidentate ligand), significantly mitigate Re complex decomposition by slightly lowering the OAT activity when immobilized in Pd/C. Further stability enhancement is then obtained by switching the nanoparticles from Pd to Rh, which exhibits high reactivity with ClOx- intermediates and thus prevents their deactivating reaction with the Re complex. Compared to Re(hoz)()-Pd/C, the new Re(hoz)(htz)-Rh/C catalyst exhibits similar ClO- reduction activity but superior stability, evidenced by a decrease of Re leaching from % to .% and stability of surface Re speciation following the treatment of a concentrated ""challenge"" solution containing  ppm of ClO-.

Canadian biomasses as fibrous materials are naturally renewable and have the potential to absorb oil-spills at different ranges. In this work, four Canadian biomasses were examined in order to evaluate their oil affinities and study parameters that could affect oil affinity when used as sorbent, such as average particle size, surface coating and reusability. Moreover, one oil sorption model was adopted and coupled with another developed model to approximate and verify the experimental findings of the oil sorbent biomasses. At an average particle size of - mu m, results showed that barley straw biomass had the highest absorbency value at . g/g, while flax straw had the lowest value at . g/g. Wheat and oat straws had oil absorbency values of . and . g/g, respectively. An average particle size of - mu m indicated better absorbency values for oat and wheat straws. Furthermore, the thermal stability study revealed major weight recovery for two flame retardant coatings at hemicellulose and lignocellulose degradation temperature ranges. It was also found that oat straw biomass could be regenerated and used for many sorption/desorption cycles, as the reusability experiment showed only a .% reduction in the oil absorbency value after six consecutive cycles. The developed penetration absorbency (PA) model showed oat straw adsorbed oil at the inter-particle level; and, the results of the sorption capacity model coupled with the PA model excellently predicted the oil sorption of raw and coated oat straws.

We determined the effect of two manure application methods on P fate in a corn (Zea mays L.)-soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] production system, with and without a winter rye (Secale cereale L.)-oat (Avena sativa L.) cover crop. Treatments included: i) no manure; ii) knife injection; and iii) low-disturbance injection, each with and without the cover crop. Simulated rainfall runoff was analyzed for dissolved reactive P (DRP) and total P (TP). Rainfall was applied  d after manure application (early November) and again in May after emergence of the corn crop. Manure application increased soil bioavailable P in the - to -cm layer following knife injection and in the - to -cm layer following low-disturbance injection. The low-disturbance system caused less damage to the cover crop, so that P uptake was more than threefold greater. Losses of DRP were greater in both fall and spring following low-disturbance injection; however, application method had no effect on TP loads in runoff in either season. The cover crop reduced fall TP losses from plots with manure applied by either method. In spring, DRP losses were significantly higher from plots with the recently killed cover crop, but TP losses were not affected. Low-disturbance injection of swine manure into a standing cover crop can minimize plant damage and P losses in surface runoff while providing optimum P availability to a subsequent agronomic crop.",,"Kovar, JL|Moorman, TB|Singer, JW|Cambardella, CA|Tomer, MD",JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY,,10.2134/jeq2010.0184

Previous studies suggest that TL-RG measurements can potentially provide accurate estimates of aquifer characteristics in an aquifer pumping test experiment when used in a coupled hydrogeophysical inversion approach. However, these studies considered highly idealized conditions. The aim of this paper is twofold: first, we investigate three major issues which likely limit the practical utility of TL-RG for pumping test monitoring: partially penetrating pumping wells in anisotropic aquifers, delayed drainage effects, and typical data errors for TL-RG. Second, we introduce TL-MRS in a similar coupled hydrogeophysical inversion framework and compare the performance of TL-MRS and TL-RG for pumping test monitoring. For this purpose we consider a virtual pumping test, for which we generate synthetic drawdown, TL-MRS and TL-RG observations, and subsequently determine the aquifer parameters in an inverse parameter estimation approach. The inclusion of TL-RG and TL-MRS data did slightly improve parameter estimates for the specific yield and hydraulic conductivity when considering a fully penetrating well and minimal data error. Using more conservative TL-RG and TL-MRS data error estimates according our own field experience strongly limited the informative value of the TL-RG data; TL-MRS data was less affected by this. For a partially penetrating well under anisotropic conditions, parameter uncertainty could be reduced more effectively compared to a fully penetrating well. Delayed drainage effects did not limit the ability of the TL-MRS and TL-RG data to reduce parameter uncertainty significantly. The incorporation of representative measurement error correlation in the TL-RG data did not affect its informative value. A local sensitivity analysis showed that observations were most sensitive to the pumping rate and the thickness, specific yield, and hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer. The inclusion of TL-MRS data proved to be more effective to constrain the aquifer parameters compared with TL-RG. The inclusion of both TL-RG and TL-MRS had limited added value compared to TL-MRS only. We conclude that this particular application of coupled hydrogeophysical inversion has limited potential for TL-RG, while TL-MRS appears to be a more promising method.",,"Herckenrath, D|Auken, E|Christiansen, L|Behroozmand, AA|Bauer-Gottwein, P",WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,,10.1029/2011WR010411

In this paper, initially, DSA optimized classical PI/PIDF controller is implemented to an identical two-area thermal-thermal power system and then the study is extended to two more realistic power systems which are widely used in the literature. To assess the usefulness of DSA, three enhanced competitive algorithms namely comprehensive learning particle swarm optimization (CLPSO), ensemble of mutation and crossover strategies and parameters in differential evolution (EPSDE), and success history based DE (SHADE) are studied in this paper. Moreover, the superiority of proposed DSA optimized PI/PID/PIDF controller is validated by an extensive comparative analysis with some recently published meta-heuristic algorithms such as firefly algorithm (FA), bacteria foraging optimization algorithm (BFOA), genetic algorithm (GA), craziness based particle swarm optimization (CRPSO), differential evolution (DE), teaching-learning based optimization (TLBO), particle swarm optimization( PSO), and quasi-oppositional harmony search algorithm (QOHSA).

Tests involved multiple combinations of rain intensities and runoff conditions for selected screenings of the equivalent parameter space, resorting to one-at-a-time displacements and Latin hypercube samples. Sensitivity to spatial distributions of erosion parameters was calculated as a normalized index of numerical spread of soil loss results, obtained at the outlet of a nine-cell virtual catchment endowed with a fixed flow pattern.

Sampling-based techniques, that resort to extensive exploration of the space of possible model inputs are a common approach. When inputs uncertainties can be described statistically by means of probability distribution functions, Monte Carlo simulation yields a statistical description of uncertain model outputs. However, the combination of commonly encountered input space dimensions and model CPU times often makes this approach hardly practicable. We propose to assess the potential of a local sensitivity analysis for uncertainty analysis in the modelling of open channel flows with the one-dimensional shallow water equations, which are generally viewed as being largely non linear. The first-order local sensitivity is simply assessed using the so-called empirical method requiring only two runs of the model (for a single uncertain parameter). The global sampling-based approach consists in running Monte Carlo simulations with the hydrodynamic model, given a statistical distribution of the model input parameters. Monte Carlo results can be analysed through classical statistical estimators, such as mean and standard deviation. It is shown that these characteristics can also be accurately estimated from the local sensitivity and the input distribution.

The problems arise in the context of the general theory of elastic stability (Koiter's theory) for discrete structural systems, in which the total potential energy is employed together with a stability criterion based on energy derivatives. The imperfection sensitivity of critical states, such as bifurcations and trifurcations, is usually represented as a plot of the critical load versus the amplitude epsilon of the imperfection considered. However, such plots have a singularity at the point with. epsilon = , so that a regular perturbation expansion of the solution is not possible. in this work, we describe a direct procedure to obtain the sensitivity of the critical load (eigenvalue of the bifurcation problem) and the sensitivity of the critical direction (eigenvector of the bifurcation problem) using singular perturbation analysis. The perturbation expansions are constructed as a power series in terms of the imperfection amplitude, in which the exponents and the coefficients are the unknowns of the problem. The solution of the exponents is obtained by means of trial and error using a least degenerate criterion, or by geometrical considerations. To compute the coefficients a detailed formulation is presented, which employs the conditions of equilibrium and stability at the critical state and their contracted forms. The formulation is applied to symmetric bifurcations, and the coefficients are solved up to third-order terms in the expansion. The algorithm is illustrated by means of a simple example (a beam on an elastic foundation under axial load) for which the coefficients are computed and the imperfection-sensitivity is plotted."," Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Godoy, LA|Banchio, EG",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUMERICAL METHODS IN ENGINEERING,bifurcation buckling imperfection-sensitivity instability perturbation techniques sensitivity analysis,10.1002/nme.266

The Root Zone Water Quality Model (RZWQM) has been subjected to various sensitivity analyses; however, in most of these efforts a local sensitivity analysis method was implemented, the nonlinear response was neglected, and the dependency among parameters was not examined. In this study we employed a comprehensive global sensitivity analysis to quantify the contribution of  model input parameters (including  hydrological parameters and  nitrogen cycle parameters) on the uncertainty of key RZWQM outputs relevant to raspberry row crops in Abbotsford, BC, Canada. Specifically,  model outputs that capture various vertical-spatial and temporal domains were investigated. A rank transformation method was used to account for the nonlinear behavior of the model. The variance of the model outputs was decomposed into correlated and uncorrelated partial variances to provide insight into parameter dependency and interaction. The results showed that, in general, the field capacity (soil water content at -  kPa) in upper  cm of the soil horizon had the greatest contribution (>%) to the estimate of the water flux and evapotranspiration uncertainty. The most influential parameters affecting the simulation of soil nitrate content, mineralization, denitrification, nitrate leaching and plant nitrogen uptake were the transient coefficient of fast to intermediate humus pool, the carbon to nitrogen ratio of the fast humus pool, the organic matter decay rate in fast humus pool, and field capacity. The correlated contribution to the model output uncertainty was <% for the set of parameters investigated.

However, detectable levels of neonicotinoids have also been found in wetlands during early spring, after ice-off but before crop seeding, representing an unexpected long-term exposure risk for aquatic organisms. This suggests long-term persistence, though origins and transport mechanisms remain unknown. We sampled  agricultural fields in the Canadian Prairies to investigate whether snow meltwater, particulate matter, top- ( cm) or bottom-layer ( cm) snow were potential sources of spring neonicotinoid contamination to receiving wetlands. Agricultural fields were selected based on the previous year's crop: eight canola fields (clothianidin-treated seed) and eight oat fields (untreated). We further sampled the wetlands draining those same oat and canola fields from ice-off to seeding to assess changes in neonicotinoid concentrations overtime. Top-layer snow was below the limit of quantification for both canola and oat fields. Neonicotinoid concentrations (sum of clothianidin and thiamethoxam) were highest in meltwater (canola, mean:  +/- . ng L-; max: ), but also detected in bottom-layer snow (oat, mean: . +/- . ng L-; max: .), and soil particulate matter (canola, mean: . +/- . mu g/kg; max: .). Concentrations in meltwater showed a stronger relationship (R- = .) with initial concentrations in wetland water than any other source type. Temporary wetland hydrology is largely fed by meltwater thus spring total neonicotinoid concentrations were higher in temporary wetlands than seasonal/semi-permanent wetlands (P = .). Only clothianidin was detected in soil particulate matter samples, including from oat fields not treated the year before, confirming this compound can persist over multiple years under local field conditions. The results of this study suggest that under normal agricultural practices, wetlands in colder climates are likely to be contaminated even before seeding occurs through persistence of neonicotinoids in soil and transport by snowmelt and particulate to surface water during spring runoff.", (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

To increase the reliability of the hydrological model predictions, an uncertainty analysis was conducted by perturbing input parameters using a Monte-Carlo technique. The SWAT model was then run using a baseline scenario corresponding to an actual measured time series of daily temperature and precipitation, and six climate change scenarios.

The resistance of these enzymes to copper pollution was also estimated. Soil samples were contaminated with copper chloride. The experiment was carried out in five replications, in two series. The first series was performed on uncropped soil and the second one - on cropped soil. The experimental plants were oat, spring rape and yellow lupine. The activity of soil enzymes was determined in the analyzed samples on the th and the th day of the experiment. The results of the experiment showed that copper contamination in doses of  mg to  mg.kg(-) soil significantly inhibits soil's biochemical activity. The sensitivity of the tested enzymes to copper was determined in the following order: alkaline phosphatase > arylsulfatase > acid phosphatase > beta-glucosidase. The resistance of the above enzymes to copper depended on the cultivated plant species, soil type and the type of soil use and management. In samples of sandy loam, copper induced the smallest change in the activity of acid phosphatase and alkaline phosphatase, and in loamy sand - in the activity of arylsulfatase and acid phosphatase. In uncropped soil, copper was the least effective in changing the activity of arylsulfatase and acid phosphatase. All of the tested enzymes were less resistant to copper contamination in cropped than in uncropped soil. In soil planted with oat, beta-glucosidase was the most resistant and arylsulfatase was the least resistant enzyme to copper contamination.

I: Sensitivity analysis,ESTUARINE EUTROPHICATION MODEL WELL-MIXED ESTUARIES OPTIMIZATION,"A method is presented to compute sensitivities of in-stream dissolved oxygen (DO) with respect to perturbations in the load vector and the reaction coefficients that make up the eutrophication cycle. It is shown that the direct sensitivity method, i.e., the repetitive solution of the direct problem, produces the desired information, however at a large computational cost. The utilization of the adjoint sensitivity method proves to be a much more efficient way to compute these sensitivities as large subsets of the sensitivity information domain can be easily extracted with just a few runs. It is found that for the given problem setup, in-stream DO is most sensitive to ammonia, effluent DO, algae, and carbonaceous biochemical oxygen demand (CBOD) loads. Additionally, the computed sensitivities vary considerably in their general trend over the simulation time. Sensitivities also are computed with respect to the reaction coefficients ( total) that govern the interdependency of all constituents. Sediment oxygen demand proves to be the coefficient with the highest influence that is three orders of magnitude higher than the next set of coefficients comprised of reaeration, CBOD degradation, nitrification, and denitrification.

Such an analysis utilizes the following metrics: (a) Sobol-Saltelli sensitivity indices and cumulative distribution functions if perturbations of model parameters are random, and (b) a Hartley-like measure if perturbations of model parameters are nonrandom and parametrized through fuzzy sets. The indices and the Hartley-like measure allow for ranging model parameters along their significance to the model output. Our calculations demonstrate that accurate estimates of the sensitivity indices are possible even if an ensemble of random perturbations contains considerably less than  members. Some calculations were successfully provided for random ensembles with - members only but, in general - member ensembles are required to get robust and significant estimations of model sensitivity. The fuzzy set concept allows for robust estimations for small size nonrandom ensembles of model outputs (- members) and accounts for additional a priori information on model sensitivity coming from different sources.

The claimed connection of TIR emission with seismic activity has been considered, up to now, with some caution by the scientific community mainly for the insufficiency of the validation data-sets and the scarce importance attached by those authors to other causes (e.g. meteorological) that, rather than seismic activity, could be responsible for the observed TIR signal fluctuations. In this paper, a robust satellite data analysis technique is described which pen-nits us to identify anomalous space-time TIR signal transients even in very variable observational (satellite view angle, land topography and coverage, etc.) and natural (e.g. meteorological) conditions. A statistically well-founded definition of TIR anomaly is given and proposed as a suitable tool for satellite TIR surveys in seismically active regions. Eight years of Meteosat TIR observations have been analyzed in order to characterize the TIR signal behavior at each specific observation time and location. Space-time TIR signal transients have then been analyzed, both in the presence (validation) and in the absence of (confutation) seismic events, looking for possible space-time relationships. The devastating earthquake which occurred in Turkey (Izmit.. August , M(S)similar to .) in  has been considered as a test case for validation, relatively unperturbed periods (no earthquakes with M > ) were taken for confutation purposes. Quite intense (S/N > .) and rare, spatially extensive and time persistent, TIR signal transients were identified appearing eight days before the Izmit main shock in Greece, moving to Turkey on August  and disappearing, moving back to Greece, some days after. Possible implications of such results, together with present limitations of the proposed technique, will also be discussed in the light of the improved performances expected by its extension to other existing or future satellite packages.", (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

The most popular stochastic theories are still based on closed-form solutions that apply, strictly speaking. only for statistically uniform flows. In this paper, we present an efficient, nonstationary spectral approach for modeling complex stochastic flows in moderately heterogeneous media. Specifically, we reformulate the governing stochastic equations and introduce a new transfer function to characterize the propagation of system uncertainty. The new transfer function plays a similar role as the commonly used Green's functions in classical stochastic perturbation methods but is more amenable to numerical solution. The compact transfer function can be used to construct efficiently various spatial statistics of interest, such as covariances, cross-covariances, variances, and mean closure fluxes. We demonstrate the advantages of the proposed approach by applying it to a number of nonstationary problems, including a large, complex problem that is difficult to solve by traditional methods. In particular, we focus in this paper on demonstrating the new approach's ability to compute efficiently covariances and cross-covariances critical for measurement conditioning, monitoring network analyses, and stochastic transport modeling in the presence of complex mean flow nonstationarities (caused, e.g., by complex trends in aquifer properties, boundary conditions, and sources and sinks). This paper is an extension of our recent work that illustrated the basic approach for modeling nonlocal and nonstationary scale effects and uncertainty propagation in relatively simple situations.

Although many studies indicated a key role of the viral protein Tax in the control of viral transcription, the mechanisms controlling HTLV- expression and its persistence in vivo are still poorly understood. To assess Tax effects on viral kinetics, we developed a HTLV- model. Two parameters that capture both its deterministic and stochastic behavior were quantified: Tax signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), which measures the effect of stochastic phenomena on Tax expression as the ratio between the protein steady-state level and the variance of the noise causing fluctuations around this value; t(/), a parameter representative of the duration of Tax transient expression pulses, that is, of Tax bursts due to stochastic phenomena. Sensitivity analysis indicates that the major determinant of Tax SNR is the transactivation constant, the system parameter weighting the enhancement of retrovirus transcription due to transactivation. In contrast, t(/) is strongly influenced by the degradation rate of the mRNA. In addition to shedding light into the mechanism of Tax transactivation, the obtained results are of potential interest for novel drug development strategies since the two parameters most affecting Tax transactivation can be experimentally tuned, e. g. by perturbing protein phosphorylation and by RNA interference.",,"Corradin, A|Di Camillo, B|Ciminale, V|Toffolo, G|Cobelli, C",JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY,gillespie's exact stochastic simulations htlv-1 stochasticity in gene circuits sensitivity analysis transactivation,10.1089/cmb.2010.0219

We use the massively parallel version of the multiphase multicomponent simulator TOUGH to simulate CO/brine migration and pressure buildup within the CO storage formation and overlying/underlying formations. We evaluate the impact of parameter uncertainty on risk-related performance measures, i.e., CO saturation and pressure buildup at multiple locations, and the extent of the CO plume and overpressure zone. We compare three sensitivity analysis methods: a local sensitivity method and the global Morris and Sobol'/Saltelli methods. The uncertainty of sensitivity indices in the global methods is evaluated so that we can interpret the results even when we have a limitation in the computational resources. Results show that the three methods provide complementary information for identifying important parameters and system understanding. All three methods give consistent interpretations and importance rankings, except when a parameter has a significant non-linear effect and/or strong interaction with some other parameters. In addition to the magnitude of parameter sensitivity, our analysis emphasizes the direction (i.e., favorable or adverse in the risk perspective), non-linearity and/or interaction effects, and physical interpretation of each parameter sensitivity trend. Parameter importance varies with time and space, and also depends on the CO plume or pressure behaviors. In this study, the reservoir permeability is among the most important parameters for all measures, although it has a large trade-off effect in risk such that a higher permeability would tend to reduce reservoir pressure but, at the same time, increase the size of the CO plume footprint.

In the proposed framework, construction projects are conceptualized as metanetworks composed of different nodes (i.e., human agents, information, resources, and tasks) and links. The effects of uncertain events are translated into perturbations in the nodes and links of project metanetworks. These uncertainty-induced perturbations are reflected as transformations in a project's topological structure, and thus negatively affect the efficiency of the project's metanetwork. The extent of the variation in the efficiency of a project's metanetwork is used to determine the extent of vulnerability to uncertainty. The application of the proposed framework is shown in an illustrative case study related to a tunneling project. In the case study, various scenarios related to different uncertain events were simulated through the use of dynamic network analysis and Monte Carlo simulation. The illustrative case study demonstrated the application of the proposed framework for predictive assessment and proactive mitigation of vulnerability to uncertainty based on evaluation of dynamic interactions between various entities and networks in construction projects.

The required number of random realizations to achieve a successful approximation linearly depends on the function dimensionality. The computational cost of the model construction is quadratic in the number of random inputs, which potentially tackles the curse of dimensionality in high-dimensional stochastic functions. Furthermore, this vector-valued separated representation-based model, in comparison to the available scalar-valued case, leads to a significant reduction in the cost of approximation by an order of magnitude equal to the vector size. The performance of the method is studied through its application to three numerical examples including a -dimensional elliptic PDE and a -dimensional cavity flow.", (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

In this study, ACC deaminase-producing bacteria were isolated from a salt-impacted (approximate to  dS/m) farm field, and their ability to promote plant growth of barley and oats in saline soil was investigated in pouch assays (% NaCl), greenhouse trials (. dS/m), and field trials (- dS/m). A mix of previously isolated PGPB strains UW (Pseudomonas sp.) and UW (P. sp.) was also tested for comparison. Rhizobacterial isolate CMH (P. corrugata) and UW+UW partially alleviated plant salt stress in growth pouch assays. In greenhouse trials, CMH enhanced root biomass of barley and oats by % and %, respectively. UW+UW, CMH and isolate CMH also enhanced barley and oat shoot growth by %-%. In field tests, shoot biomass of oats tripled when treated with UW+UW and doubled with CHM compared with that of untreated plants.

This paper presents a Monte Carlo approach to propagate the uncertainty about model parameters and error component through the Michaelis-Menten equation, yielding a probability distribution for both pollutant degradation rate and time for cleanup to some prescribed level. The procedure is illustrated using data related to the degradation kinetics of halogenated hydrocarbons by Methylomicrobium album BG. It is shown that the assumption of homosce-dasticity of the error variance in the Michaelis-Menten model is usually inappropriate, and analytical expressions are derived to account for the dependence of the error variance on the concentration of substrate. Depending on the substrate, the addition of formate might have a significant impact on the expected degradation rates and times, and the proposed approach allows one to test statistically such an impact for various substrate concentrations.",,"Goovaerts, P|Semrau, J|Lontoh, S",ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY,,10.1021/es001980q

In recent years, there has been growing interest in changes in local climate and environment as major reasons why the settlement was abandoned about  years ago. Food shortage has been regarded as a direct effect of these changes. No attention has been paid to the potential health hazards associated with ancient urban/domestic pollution, although large garbage deposits have been found in several parts of the site. During excavations in , four soil samples were taken under aseptic conditions at a depth of .- m in a stratified deposit sealed by the floor of a small house, dated to the second half of the third millennium BC. Microbiological, palynological, carpological and microanalytical studies were performed on the four soil samples. Site C was identified as the most affected by human activity. Failure of conventional methods of detecting culturable and unculturable microbes in site C indicated the need for specific culture conditions suggested by palynological observations. Since oat seed residues were identified among the archaeobotanical material, oat bran was used as carbon and energy source to make a new medium to revive microbes. Coarsely ground oat bran was sterilized twice and soaked with minimal medium as sole carbon source. About  mg of buried soil from site C was added to the medium in cell culture flasks with aerobic and anaerobic stoppers and incubated at - degrees C and at  degrees C. After incubation under aerobic and anaerobic conditions, five sporogenic microbes were identified by sequencing S rDNA and ITS rRNA regions: a sporogenic strain IRO identified as Bacillus sp. was the only isolate under anaerobic conditions, whereas under aerobic conditions four moulds were isolated: Aspergillus flavus IRC, Penicillium crysogenum IRC, Cladosporium sp. IRC, and the psychrotroph Aspergillus restrictus IRC. Bacillus sp., with .% similarity to Bacillus subtilis, broke down oat bran, producing a gel, while Cladosporium sp., with .% similarity to Cladosporium sphaerospermium, grew on oat bran by synthesizing intracellular lipids. All these microbes are known to spoil food and they are common where there is intense human activity. (c) ", Elsevier Ltd.

Fly ash (FA) resulted from coal combustion at the CET Timisoara power plant, can be used as supplement to an organic fertilizer, such as manure (M) to restore the balance of micro-and macronutrients, important to obtain healthy cereal crops and high productions. FA application has immediate, direct and long lasting effects on the improvement of the physical-chemical characteristics of the agricultural soils, on the uptake of the nutrients from the soil by plants, and obtaining of high yielded cereal crops. Four treatments, each consisting of three replicates, were realized in randomized block design. The experimental variants were: control, t.ha(-) FA, t.ha(-) FA in combination with manure t.ha(-) respectively, t.ha(-). Applying fly ash in combination with an organic source of macronutrients, manure (FA + M), determined an increase of straw quantity with -% and of grain with -% for Avena sativa species, compared with the control.

We use novel sensitivity analysis of stochastic simulation models to analyse the demography of the worlds highest-density and longest-studied population of eastern imperial eagles (Aquila heliaca), at the Naurzum National Nature Reserve in Kazakhstan. Single variable perturbation (a simple elasticity-type analysis) showed that population growth was most sensitive to changes in adult survival but provided no information on how interactions between parameters may influence population growth. Multiple-variable perturbations (a more comprehensive elasticity-type analysis) suggested that population growth is relatively more sensitive to adult survival than is indicated by single-variable perturbation but also that when adult survival is within a biologically reasonable range, other parameters are still highly consequential to model outputs. For Naurzum's imperial eagles, and for other structured populations of vertebrates, effective conservation and management likely requires an approach that addresses the importance of simultaneous variation in multiple vital rates including both survivorship and reproductive output.

Accelerated phenanthrene biodegradation rates occurred in soils amended with slender oat root exudates as well as combined root debris + root exudate as compared with unamended controls. Root exudates significantly enhanced phenanthrene biodegradation in rhizosphere soils, either by increasing contaminant bioavailability and/or increasing microbial population size and activity. A modified most probable number (MPN) method was used to determine quantitative shifts in heterotrophic and phenanthrene degrader communities. During the first  to  d of treatment, heterotrophic populations increased in all amended soils. Both root debris-amended and exudate-amended soil then maintained larger phenanthrene degrader populations than in control soils later in the experiment after much of the phenanthrene had been utilized.

S. Army Corps of Engineers and has been used for flood protection in some large rivers. In its use for the real-time management of levee and drainage districts for flood protection, such as on the Mississippi River Basin, the required number of simulations for combinations of scenarios would present a great challenge for modelers to provide data for operational-mode decision making. The goal of this paper is to identify the most sensitive parameters for the spillway, simple levee failure, and complicated levee failure options in UNET so that simulations for real-time operation can focus on the most sensitive parameters without sacrificing much modeling accuracy. The sensitivity analysis was performed for the -year frequency flood in the lower Illinois River during which the Thompson Lake Levee and Drainage District or the Emiquon Area were used as temporary flood storage by using a state-of-the-art variance-based sensitivity analysis method-extended Fourier amplitude sensitivity test (FAST). The first-order and total-effect sensitivity indexes computed from the FAST method were used to evaluate the affect of the parameters to flood-peak reduction. As a result, the least and most sensitive variables for the spillway, simple levee failure, and complicated levee failure options in UNET were identified, and this knowledge helps significantly reduce the number of simulations for management scenarios by focusing on only the most sensitive parameters.

The model takes into account the amount of interception storage to be filled using a modified Merriam () approach before estimating infiltration by the Smith and Parlange () method. The mechanics of overland and channel flow are modelled by the kinematic wave approximation of the Saint Venant equations which are then numerically solved by the weighted four-point implicit finite difference method. In this modelling the watershed was discretized into overland planes and channels using the algorithms proposed by Garbrecht and Martz (). The model code was first validated by comparing the model output with an analytical solution for a hypothetical plane. Then the model was tested in a medium-sized semi-forested watershed of Pathri Rao located in the Shivalik ranges of the Garhwal Himalayas, India. Initially, a local sensitivity analysis was performed to identify the parameters to which the model outputs like runoff volume, peak flow and time to peak flow are sensitive. Before going for model validation, calibration was performed using the Ordered-Physics-based Parameter Adjustment (OPPA) method. The proposed Physically Based Distributed (PBD) model was then evaluated both at the watershed outlet as well as at the internal gauging station, making this study a first of its kind in Indian watersheds. The results of performance evaluation indicate that the model has simulated the runoff hydrographs reasonably well within the watershed as well as at the watershed outlet with the same set of calibrated parameters. The model also simulates, realistically, the temporal variation of the spatial distribution of runoff over the watershed and the same has been illustrated graphically."," Copyright (c) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Ramasankaran, RAAJ|Kothyari, UC|Ghosh, SK|Malcherek, A|Murugesan, K",HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,blind validation distributed runoff model distributed runoff validation event oriented kinematic wave routing gis watershed model,10.1002/hyp.8271

Design/methodology/approach - When a capacitive sensor is probing its surrounding, the modification of the permittivity, the displacement or the deformation of one or more electrodes induce a signal variation which depends on the position of the modification. Seeing that modification as a small perturbation and using Gauss identity, it is possible to find integral expressions of the sensor sensitivity map. Findings - Capacitive sensor sensitivity map expressions depend only on the perturbation to measure, on the electric field before the perturbation, and on a sensitivity field which is the electric field produced by the sensor when the measuring electrode is held to  V while the others, except the floating ones, are grounded. The sensitivity field is a kind of Green's function for the capacitive sensor. The knowledge of the electric and sensitivity fields makes it possible to obtain the whole sensor sensitivity map at once without requiring time consuming parametric calculations. Originality/value - The sensitivity field calculation provides a simple and direct view of the capacitive sensor capabilities.

Indeed, the sensitivity of the hydraulic head to the hydraulic conductivity extends mainly in the flow direction, while the sensitivity to the recharge spreads radially. Besides, the sensitivity of the flow longitudinal velocity to the hydraulic conductivity propagates in both the longitudinal and transverse directions, whereas the sensitivity of the flow transverse velocity propagates in the diagonal directions to the flow. The analytical results are confirmed by application examples on idealized and real-world simulations These analytical findings allow some general rules to be established for model design, model calibration and monitoring network design In particular, the optimal location of measurement points depends on the nature of the variable of interest.

Spatially and temporally resolved absolute and relative reactivities of  organic compounds and CO were calculated. In order to compare different species, the emissions of all the targeted organic compounds were perturbed equally. This perturbation followed the same spatial distribution as the total anthropogenic VOC emissions. Despite the variability (both spatial and temporal) in the absolute values, relative reactivities were fairly constant. Different types of domain-wide reactivity metrics were considered. All the three-dimensional metrics showed a high level of inter-species consistency among them and had a low day-to-day variability. Domain-wide metrics were comparable with box model scales, but showed a less dynamic inter-species behavior. Ranking of the three-dimensional metrics was very similar to the box model scales. It was also found that including the biogenic VOC emissions in the perturbation pattern has little effect on the results.

We propose a scenario-based multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) framework to compare different infrastructure alternatives in terms of their sustainability. These range from the current centralized system to semi- and fully decentralized options. Various sources of uncertainty are considered, including external socio-economic uncertainty captured by future scenarios, uncertainty in predicting outcomes of alternatives, and incomplete preferences of stakeholders. Stochastic Multi-criteria Acceptability Analysis (SMAA) with Monte Carlo simulation is performed, and rank acceptability indices help identify robust alternatives. We propose step-wise local sensitivity analysis, which is useful for practitioners to effectively elicit preferences and identify major sources of uncertainty. The approach is demonstrated in a Swiss case study where ten stakeholders are involved throughout. Their preferences are quantitatively elicited by combining an online questionnaire with face-to-face interviews. The trade-off questions reveal a high concern about environmental and an unexpectedly low importance of economic criteria. This results in a surprisingly good ranking of high-tech decentralized wastewater alternatives using urine source separation for most stakeholders in all scenarios. Combining scenario planning and MCDA proves useful, as the performance of wastewater infrastructure systems is indeed sensitive to socio-economic boundary conditions and the other sources of uncertainty. The proposed sensitivity analysis suggests that a simplified elicitation procedure is sufficient in many cases. Elicitation of more information such as detailed marginal value functions should only follow if the sensitivity analysis finds this necessary. Moreover, the uncertainty of rankings can be considerably reduced by better predictions of the outcomes of alternatives.

Firstly, the unit costs of maintenance activities and their durability (i.e. the time between two activities) are evaluated. Pragmatic data are provided for the environment category C and for three activities: Patch Up, Overcoating and Remove & Replace. A comparative LCCA for a typical hypothetic steel girder bridge is carried out, either painted or hot-dip galvanized (HDG), in the environmental class C. The LCC versus the cumulated life is provided for both options. The initial cost of the steel unpainted option is only .% of the HDG option. It is shown that after 'Overcoating' occurring at . years, the total Net Present Value (NPV) of the painted option surpasses that of the HDG option. A sensitivity analysis of the NPV to the cost and service life parameters, the escalation and discount rates is then performed. The discount and escalation rates, considerably influences the total LCC, following a non-linear trend. The total LCC decreases with the discount rate increasing and, conversely, increases with the escalation rate increasing. Secondly, the influence of the maintenance scenario on the total LCC is assessed based on a probabilistic approach. A permutation of the three independent maintenance activities assumed to occur six times over the life of the bridge is considered and a probability of occurrence is associated to each unique scenario. The most probable scenarios are then classified according to their NPV or achieved service life. This approach leads to the definition of a cost-effective maintenance scenario i.e. the scenario, within all the considered permutations, that has the minimum LCC in a range of lifespan. Besides, the probabilistic analysis also shows that, whatever the scenario, the return on investment period ranges between . years and . years. After that period, the HDG option becomes economic.

Phytoremediation is an effective method to reduce the concentration of petroleum in soils, and plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) play an important role in the phytoremediation. Two PGPR, Pseudomonas aeruginosa SLC- and Serratia marcescens BC-, were isolated from the rhizophere of Echinochloa grown in petroleum-contaminated soil. These isolates showed capacities for -aminocyclopropane--carboxylate (ACC) deaminase activity, indole acetic acid production, siderophore synthesis, and the degradation of petroleum. The ACC deaminase activity of SLC- and BC- was . +/- . mu mol alpha-KA (mg Pr.h)(-) and . +/- . mu mol alpha-KA (mg Pr.h)(-), respectively. On the other hand, when the concentration of L-Trp increased, the IAA synthesis of BC- also increased, while the synthesis of SLC- did not change significantly. The ability of synthesized siderophore of SLC- was much higher than that of BC-. The petroleum degradations of SLC- and BC- increased . and . %, respectively. The pot experiment of oat was performed to evaluate the plant growth-promoting abilities of SLC- and BC-.

The method can be extended to sensitivities of the other performance measure functions. The adjoint-variable methods for design-sensitivity analysis offer computational speed and accuracy. They can be used for efficiency-based gradient optimization, in tolerance and yield analyses. In this work, an arbitrarily configured microwave amplifier is considered: firstly, each element in the network is modeled by the scattering matrix formulation, then the topology of the network is taken into account using the connection scattering-matrix formulation. The wave approach is utilized in the evaluation of all the performance-measurement functions, then sensitivity invariants are formulated using Tellegen's theorem. Performance sensitivities of the T- and Pi-types of distributed-parameter amplifiers are considered as a worked example.

The roles of fertilisation rate, composting of recycled plant residues and stage of the rotations in the overall impact of the cropping systems on soil quality and AM were also identified. The conventional cropping system with a non-leguminous crop rotation (barley-barley-rye-oat-potato-oat) was fertilised at either full or half the recommended rate. In the low-input cropping system, one year with barley was replaced by clover, and oat was cultivated mixed with pea. Straw and clover were returned to the soil either with or without composting. In the low-input system, biotite and rock phosphate were used to compensate for K and P in the harvested yield, while animal manure was applied at the start only. After  years, crop growth and nutrition, AMF colonisation and soil quality were assessed in the field, while the AM contribution to growth and nutrient uptake were determined in a bioassay in a growth chamber. AM functioning made a higher contribution to soil quality in terms of crop performance and environmental benefits in the low-input cropping system than at either fertilisation rate in the conventional system. Halving fertilisation in the conventional system prevented some costs and enhanced some of the benefits of AM in comparison with full fertilisation. However, only the low-input system with composting conclusively favoured AM in comparison with the conventional system. It resulted in the highest percentage colonisation and, in a bioassay with flax and clover, gave a relative average contribution to growth of % and to P uptake of % in comparison with  and %, respectively, for the conventional cropping system with full fertilisation. Rye yield was in the low-input system without composting similar to that in the conventional system with full fertilisation, and with composting % of the latter one. Incorporation of clover green manure without composting inhibited AM functioning, leading to a temporary loss of AM contribution to crop performance. This effect draws attention to the impact of the form of recycled organic matter on supporting ecosystem services such as nutrient cycling.", (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

In order to examine the possibility of estimating OD matricies in real-time, two constrained OD estimators, based on generalized least squares and Kalman filtering, were developed and tested. A one-at-a-time processing method was introduced to provide an efficient organized framework for incorporating observations from multiple data sources in real-time. The estimators were tested under different conditions based on the type of prior OD information available, the type of assignment available, and the type of link volume model used. The performance of the Kalman filter estimators also was compared to that of the generalized least squares estimator to provide insight regarding their performance characteristics relative to one another for given scenarios. Automatic vehicle identification (AVI) tag counts were used so that observed and estimated OD parameters could be compared. While the approach was motivated using AVI data, the methodology can be generalized to any situation where traffic counts are available and origin volumes can be estimated reliably. The primary means by which AVI data was utilized was through the incorporation of prior observed OD information as measurements, the inclusion of a deterministic link volume component that makes use of OD data extracted from the latest time interval from which all trips have been completed, and through the use of link choice proportions estimated based on link travel time data. It was found that utilizing prior observed OD data along with link counts improves estimator accuracy relative to OD estimation based exclusively on link counts.",,"Dixon, MP|Rilett, LR",COMPUTER-AIDED CIVIL AND INFRASTRUCTURE ENGINEERING,,10.1111/1467-8667.00248

However, these studies did not explore the sensitivities of the ML algorithms relative to ML inputs in order to determine the behavior and performance of each algorithm. In this current study, normalized sensitivity coefficients are computed to diagnose ML performance as a function of time and space. The results showed that when using the ANN, approximately % of locations across North America are relatively sensitive to snow water equivalent (SWE). However, more than % of locations in the SVM-based brightness temperature (Tb) estimates are sensitive relative to perturbations in SWE at all frequency and polarization combinations explored in this study. Further, the SVM-based results suggest the algorithm is sensitive in both shallow and deep SWE, SWE with and without overlying forest canopy, and during both the snow accumulation and snow ablation seasons.

The model incorporated environmental variation and also included uncertainty in the estimation of both the mean and the between-year variation of parameters. The sensitivity analysis indicated that the population growth rate of the model was most influenced by the values of mean adult survival, recruitment and the between-year variation in adult survival.

Although recent studies have advanced our knowledge on modeling the coupling behavior between a porous framework and the fluids permeating it, the effect of viscous resistance caused by two fluid flow on elastic wave behavior in unsaturated porous media still remains elusive. In the present study, the theoretical model developed for describing immiscible two-phase fluid flows in a deforinable porous medium related to hat inonic wave perturbation is generalized to account for viscous cross coupling due to relative velocity between two adjacent fluids. The corresponding dispersion relations whose coefficients feature all elasticity, inertial-drag, and viscous-drag parameters are then precisely formulated, in a physical context characterizing three compressional waves and one shear wave. To evaluate quantitatively this as-yet unknown effect, numerical calculations are conducted to solve the dispersion relations for Columbia fine sandy loam bearing an oil water mixture as a function of water saturation and excitation frequency. Our results show that the phase speed and attenuation coefficient of the P wave which has the smallest speed is strongly sensitive to the presence of viscous cross coupling, as expected since this wave is attributed primarily to the out-of-phase motion of the two pore fluids. Viscous cross coupling also exerts an impact on the attenuation coefficient of the shear wave and the P wave whose speed is greatest, which exhibits two opposite trends at different ranges of low and high water contents. Relative differences in these wave attributes are principally independent of excitation frequency. A sensitivity analysis is carried out to assess how changes in viscous cross coupling affect these differences, revealing that some of them become more significant as viscous cross coupling is stronger.

To do so, this paper analyzes alternative proportions of the total projects (m) that should be implemented (e.g., % and % of the total number of projects) as well as alternative standards (c) to be achieved, on average, for some indices (e.g., % and % of the average standard values, which represent the mean value of these indices for all projects). The overall analytical results are presented for both linearly and exponentially weighted constraints, using partial derivatives to perform local sensitivity analyses (i.e., for each selected or rejected project), and the results account for the effects of w, c, and m. Next, level curves are prepared over the whole domain for w to produce two-dimensional graphs that support a global sensitivity analysis (i.e., for all selected and rejected projects) and to account for the effects of w, c, and m for both linearly and exponentially weighted constraints. Application of this approach to the Iraqi national irrigation system as a case study showed that the results are less robust if a smaller proportion (%) of the total projects is chosen, with a change of up to % in the projects selected. In this context, an increase in the smallest weights for sustainability criteria also affected project choices. If the average standard to be achieved is made stricter (% of the average standard), the results become more robust, with a change of less than % in the selected projects. In this context, increases in the smallest weights for sustainability criteria did not affect the project choices.

One of the five lysimeters was also treated with methabenzthiazuron (MBT), and soil residues as well as leaching were experimentally determined. In Europe, MBT has been commonly used as a herbicide for almost  years. Generally, the use of given model inputs is recommended, apart from plant parameters, which need calibration. The use of validation criteria revealed proper simulation of water flow for the four models. After calibration, the Richards' equation - based models MARTHE, TRACE, and MACRO performed better for water flow predictions than the capacity-based ANSWERS. A small amount of preferential flow, which is not included in the model structures of MARTHE, TRACE, and ANSWERS, did not influence the simulation of water flow significantly. But preferential flow was associated with the leaching of .% of the mass of MBT, causing relevant concentrations in the leachate. Leaching could be described well with MACRO after calibration.

This paper proposes a method to select criteria for MCDM of reservoir flood control operation based on the back-propagation (BP) neural network. According to the concept of ideal and anti-ideal points, we propose a method to generate training samples of the BP neural network via stochastic simulation. The topological structure of a three-layer BP neural network used for criteria selection is established. The relative importance of criteria is derived via the learned connection weights of a trained BP neural network, and its calculation method is proposed. The sensitivity curve method is employed to conduct sensitivity analysis, and the relative contribution ratio is defined to quantify the relative sensitivity strength of each criterion. We present the principle and threshold value of criteria selection based on the comprehensive discrimination index defined by the combination of the relative importance and relative contribution ratio. The Pubugou reservoir is selected as the case study.

The continuity equation solved by the Photochemical Air Quality Model (PAQM) reproduces the atmospheric processes (dynamical, physical, chemical and radiative), such as moving and mixing air parcels from one grid cell to another, calculating chemical reactions, injecting new emissions. The whole modeling procedure includes several sources of uncertainty, especially in the large data sets that describe the status of the domain (boundary conditions, emissions, chemical reaction rates and several others). The robustness of the photochemical simulation is addressed in this work through the deterministic approach of sensitivity analysis. The automatic differentiation tool ADIFOR is applied on the D PAQM CAMx and augments its Fortran  code by introducing new lines of code that additionally calculate, in only one run, the gradient of the solution vector with respect to its input parameters.

A linear stability analysis (LSA) indicates that a continuum model of frost heave is linearly unstable under typical natural freezing conditions of silty-clay soils. A two-dimensional non-linear numerical analysis corroborates the frozen time LSA results, and also indicates the importance of non-linear and time-dependent terms that ultimately lead to a preferred mode, which the LSA fails to predict. Instability of the one-dimensional solution occurs at shallow freezing depths and near-zero surface loads when positive perturbations in the ice content at the freezing front lead to a concomitant increase in thermomolecular pressure and upward ice velocity. Differential frost heave can then occur because of the increased heat flux from the perturbed surfaces. A three-dimensional model using random initial surface perturbations indicates that regular surface patterns will evolve with a length scale in the order of - meters, which corresponds quite closely with naturally-occurring non-sorted patterned ground.",,"Peterson, RA",MATHEMATICAL GEOSCIENCES,patterned ground differential frost heave stability analysis,10.1007/s11004-008-9150-z

Each structure is meant to transform an input variable into an output one, and the flexibility of the output with respect to input variations can be expressed by a structure sensitivity indicator. The sensitivity analysis approach, applied to irrigation systems, might be considered an intermediary approach between steady and unsteady flow conditions for describing the flow behavior of irrigation canals. In this paper a preliminary analytical framework is developed to address the sensitivity of irrigation distribution systems. The development of hydraulic sensitivity indicators at local and reach levels is presented first. Then, by incorporating the time parameter in the analysis, a method for estimating a reach-time response to a perturbation is proposed. Also, a case study to evaluate the applicability of sensitivity indicators in assessing flow behavior in an irrigation canal was carried out. The results indicate that the proposed approach is capable of predicting the time required for damping a perturbation with a specified condition and provides the users with sufficient information to improve the management of water distribution in an irrigation network."," Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Kouchakzadeh, S|Montazar, A",IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE,irrigation canals indicator offtake regulator perturbation sensitivity,10.1002/ird.196

Five treatment units (TUs) were established each with similar to burrows for each season and habitat studied during -. SRO groat marker bait ( g) was placed inside each active burrow. All bait sites were re-opened about  h later and examined for the presence (all or some) or absence of bait. The average bait site disturbance after  days of baiting was .%. Traps were used to capture gophers up to  days after baiting. Valley pocket gophers (n = ) were examined for the presence of blue dye in their cheek pouches, skin/fur, and fat.

Is this the only value of high-order statistical information in policy synthesis? (ii) Will a translation of an optimal policy for the deterministic fluid model (in which there is no variability) lead to an allocation which is approximately optimal for the stochastic network? (iii) What are the sources of highest sensitivity in network control? A sensitivity analysis of an associated fluid-model optimal control problem provides an exact dichotomy in (ii). If an optimal policy for the fluid model is 'maximally non-idling', then variability plays a small role in control design. If this condition does not hold, then the 'gap' between the fluid and stochastic optimal policies is exactly proportional to system variability. Furthermore, under mild assumptions, we find that the optimal policy for the stochastic model is closely approximated by an affine shift of the fluid optimal solution.

A mathematical model for the prediction of the fluid pressure history is given by a time-dependent diffusion equation. Application of the finite-element method leads to systems of linear equations. A complication is that the underground consists of layers with very large contrasts in permeability. This implies that the symmetric and positive definite coefficient matrix has a very large condition number. Bad convergence behavior of the ICCG method has been observed, and a classical termination criterion is not valid in this problem. In [] we have shown that the number of small eigenvalues of the diagonally scaled matrix is equal to the number of high-permeability domains, which are not connected to a Dirichlet boundary. In this paper the proof is extended to an Incomplete Cholesky decomposition. To annihilate the bad effect of these small eigenvalues on the convergence. the Deflated ICCG method is used. In [] we have shown how to construct a deflation subspace for the case of a set of more or less parallel layers. That subspace proved to be a good approximation of the span of the ""small"" eigenvectors. As a result of this, the convergence Of DICCG is independent of the contrasts in the permeabilities. In this paper it is shown how to construct deflation vectors even in the case of very irregular shaped layers, and layers with so-called inclusions.

The emergy approach is an effective method for investigating these topics, especially when used to evaluate systems that have developed under the same environmental conditions, such as climate and soil. In this paper, emergy differences between terrestrial ecosystems were studied in Guyuan County, a region representative of the agro-pastoral ecotone in Hebei Province, China. A combination of field tests and a questionnaire survey were carried out between June and August . The ecosystems studied included natural grassland, artificial grassland, field crops and commercial crops. These four ecosystems were further subdivided into a total of ten ecosystems. Natural grassland was divided into free-grazing and mowed ecosystems; artificial grassland consisted of oat, Chinese leymus and corn silage; field crops included naked oats, flax and wheat; and commercial crops consisted of cabbage'and potatoes. The results showed that the rain input of . x () seJ/ha/yr constituted the highest renewable natural resource emergy and that the purchased emergy inputs of the ten ecosystems ranged from . to . x () seJ/ha/yr. Natural resource emergy input was the basic power to maintain the ecosystem, and purchased emergy input was the direct cause of the development of the ecosystems. Groundwater was the most important non-renewable purchased energy for the production of economic crops. The emergy investment ratios (EIR) for potatoes (.) and cabbage (.) were higher than those of the other ecosystems, but mowed and artificial Chinese leymus grassland had the higher emergy self-sufficiency rates (ESR). Natural grassland, artificial Chinese leymus grassland and traditional grain crops had a low environmental load and high sustainability, whereas potatoes and cabbage had a high environmental load and low sustainability. Overall, rain-fed artificial grassland has a high development potential from the perspective of environment and productivity. (C)  The Author(s). Published by", Elsevier Ltd.

This approach which is completely based on the variational method, is employed to derive the costate partial differential equations (pdes) and their transversality (boundary) conditions from the continuous pdes of the fluid flow. The costate equations coupled with the flow field equations are solved iteratively to get the functional derivative coefficients. Then, these derivative coefficients combined with the flow field variables are used to find the boundary shape which extremizes the performance index (functional). To demonstrate the method through examples, the shape of the nozzle is optimized for the maximum thrust. For this maximization problem, inlet and outlet flow conditions that depend on the upstream and downstream Mach numbers respectively are considered. In order to build confidence in the optimization procedure, high convergences of the state and costate equations were sought and the numerical and analytical solutions (in the form of pressure distributions) of the state equations are compared. In the purely supersonic flow case, the gain in thrust is remarkably high. Even in the supersonic-inlet-subsonic-outlet and the purely subsonic cases, the improvement of the thrust is found to be substantial.

We hypothesized that grazing green manures, compared with standard soil incorporation with tillage, would increase autumn soil profile NO-N concentrations and grain yields in subsequent years. Three multiyear experiments were carried out for three years between  and  in Manitoba, Canada. For all three experiments, spring-seeded oat (Avena sativa cv. Leggett) and pea/oat (A. sativa/Pisum sativum cv. -) green manure crops were grazed with sheep or left ungrazed in year one. Both treatments were soil incorporated with a tandem disk after grazing. Spring wheat (Triticum aestivum cv. Waskada) and fall rye (Secale cereale cv. Hazlet) test crops were grown in the second and third years, respectively. Biomass production was greater for pea/oat than oat in experiment ; in experiment  pea/oat = oat; and in experiment  pea/oat < oat. Grazing utilization of green manure biomass averaged % across all treatments and experiments with no utilization differences between crop species. On average, less than % of biomass consisted of weeds for both green manures. Soil NO-N to  cm was significantly greater in grazed than in ungrazed plots; however soil P and K were unaffected. Nitrate content was greater in pea/oat mixture plots for all three experiments at - cm than oat plots. The absence of a significant management x green manure type interaction indicated that both crop types responded similarly to grazing. Greater availability of soil NO-N after grazing translated into significantly greater crop growth and N uptake in some years, although significant increases in yield of following crops were not observed. Importantly, grazing green manures never negatively affected wheat or rye yield. In conclusion, grazing green manure crops increased N supply for subsequent crop production with no negative yield effects on two subsequent grain crops.", (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The external loads can induce the extreme air gap response and potential deck impact to the semi-submersible platform. It is important to predict air gap response of platforms accurately in order to check the strength of local structures which withstand the wave slamming due to negative air gap. The wind load cannot be simulated easily by model test in towing tank whereas it can be simulated accurately in wind tunnel test. Furthermore, full scale simulation of the mooring system in model test is still a tuff work especially the stiffness of the mooring system. Owing to the above mentioned problem, the model test results are not accurate enough for air gap evaluation. The aim of this paper is to present sensitivity analysis results of air gap motion with respect to the mooring system and wind load for the design of semi-submersible platform. Though the model test results are not suitable for the direct evaluation of air gap, they can be used as a good basis for tuning the radiation damping and viscous drag in numerical simulation. In the presented design example, a numerical model is tuned and validated by ANSYS AQWA based on the model test results with a simple  line symmetrical horizontal soft mooring system.

In this paper, we evaluate the performance of a flood forecasting scheme in a sparsely monitored catchment based on distributed hydrologic modeling, discharge assimilation, and numerical weather predictions with explicit validation uncertainty analysis. For the hydrologic component of our framework, we apply TopNet to the Cautin River basin, located in southern Chile, using a fully distributed a priori parameterization based on both literature-suggested values and data gathered during field campaigns. Results obtained from this step indicate that the incremental effort spent in measuring directly a set of model parameters was insufficient to represent adequately the most relevant hydrologic processes related to spatiotemporal runoff patterns. Subsequent uncertainty validation performed over a six month ensemble simulation shows that streamflow uncertainty is better represented during flood events, due to both the increase of state perturbation introduced by rainfall and the flood-oriented calibration strategy adopted here. Results from different assimilation configurations suggest that the upper part of the basin is the major source of uncertainty in hydrologic process representation and hint at the usefulness of interpreting assimilation results in terms of model input and parameterization inadequacy. Furthermore, in this case study the violation of Markovian state properties by the Ensemble Kalman filter did affect the numerical results, showing that an explicit treatment of the time delay between the generation of surface runoff and the arrival at the basin outlet is required in the assimilation scheme. Peak flow forecasting results demonstrate that there is a major problem with the Weather Research and Forecasting model outputs, which systematically overestimate precipitation over the catchment. A final analysis performed for a large flooding event that occurred in July  shows that, in the absence of bias introduced by an incorrect model calibration, the updating of both model states and meteorological forecasts contributes to a better representation of streamflow uncertainty and to better hydrologic forecasts.",,"Mendoza, PA|McPhee, J|Vargas, X",WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,,10.1029/2011WR011089

In this system, DWW is applied to a vertical flow bed through which it trickles into a reservoir located beneath the bed. It is then recirculated back to the root zone of the bed. In this study, a compartmental model was developed to simulate the RVFCW. The model, which addresses transport and removal kinetics of total suspended solids, -day biological oxygen demand and nitrogen, was fitted to kinetical results obtained from pilot field setups and a local sensitivity analysis was performed on the model parameters and operational conditions. This analysis showed that after  h of treatment water quality is affected more by stochastic events than by the model parameter values, emphasizing the stability of the RVFCW system to large variations in operational conditions. Effluent quality after  h of treatment, when the sensitivity analysis showed the parameter impacts to be largest, was compared to model predictions. The removal rate was found to be dependent on the recirculation rate. The predictions correlated well with experimental observations, leading to the conclusion that the proposed model is a satisfactory tool for studying RVFCWs. (C) ", Elsevier Ltd.

Irrespective of the choice of models, the major source of error in any hydrological modeling is the uncertainty in the determination of model parameters, owing to the mismatch between model complexity and available data. Sensitivity analysis (SA) methods help to identify the parameters that have a strong impact on the model outputs and hence influence the model response. In addition, SA assists in analyzing the interaction between parameters, its preferable range and its spatial variability, which in turn influence the model outcomes.

Model calibration and prediction uncertainty were assessed simultaneously by using three different techniques (SUFI-, GLUE and ParaSol). Initially, a sensitivity analysis was conducted using the LH-OAT method. Subsequent sensitive parameter calibration and SWAT prediction uncertainty were analysed by considering, firstly, deterministic discharge data (assuming no uncertainty in discharge data) and secondly, uncertainty in discharge data through the development of a methodology that accounts explicitly for error in the rating curve (the stage-discharge relationship). To efficiently compare the different uncertainty methods and the effect of the uncertainty of the rating curve on model prediction uncertainty, common criteria were set for the likelihood function, the threshold value and the number of simulations. The results show that model prediction uncertainty is not only case-study specific, but also depends on the selected uncertainty analysis technique. It was also found that the % model prediction uncertainty interval is wider and more successful at encompassing the observations when uncertainty in the discharge data is considered explicitly.

Many such tree models have been proposed, from the simple single-tree model to more complex tree ensembles. Their nonparametric formulation allows one to model datasets exhibiting complex non-linear relationships between the model predictors and observations. However, the mixing behavior of the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampler is sometimes poor, frequently suffering from local mode stickiness and poor mixing. This is because existing Metropolis-Hastings proposals do not allow for efficient traversal of the model space. We develop novel Metropolis-Hastings proposals that account for the topological structure of regression trees. The first is a novel tree rotation proposal that only requires local changes to the regression tree structure, yet efficiently traverses disparate regions of the model space along contours of high likelihood. The second is a rule perturbation proposal which can be seen as an efficient variation of the change proposal found in existing literature. We implement these samplers and demonstrate their effectiveness on a prediction problem from computer experiments, a test function where structural tree variability is needed to fully explore the posterior and data from a heart rate study.",,"Pratola, MT",BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,markov chain monte carlo proposal distribution computer experiments uncertainty quantification credible interval coverage probability,10.1214/16-BA999

Watershed planners have acritical need to understand GWW sediment delivery to optimally target source area management practices. Better physically based tools are needed to estimate sediment delivery by GWWs. This study developed several distributed sediment delivery ratio (SDR) regressions for GWWs using the process-based Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) model to provide simple equations to estimate sediment delivery for planning applications. Water Erosion Prediction Project was calibrated and validated for runoff and sediment yield for large .-ha and smaller .-ha nested watersheds with terraces and a common GWW outlet. A crop rotation of corn, oat and alfalfa and fall tillage using chisel plow were used in the nested watersheds. A hypothetical management case without terraces using corn, oat and alfalfa rotation with chisel plow as fall tillage was also evaluated for the .-ha watershed and the GWW. The length, slope, Manning's roughness coefficient and infiltration rate for the GWW were varied and SDRs calculated for  representative (in terms of daily rainfall) days over a -year period of simulated climate. Regressions were developed for the existing (terraced) and hypothetical (non-terraced) management scenarios for early (April-July), late (August-October) and full (April-October) growing seasons. Equations developed for the non-terrace watershed had higher R- values compared to the terraced watershed suggesting that channel and rainfall parameters were better able to explain the variation in SDR for the non-terraced watershed. Manning's roughness coefficient was the most significant parameter for predicting SDR for both the terraced and non-terraced watersheds. The equations developed here can be used to estimate SDRs for watersheds that are drained via GWWs having similar physical characteristics: slope (-%), Mannings's roughness coefficient (.-.), length (.-km) and infiltration rate (.- mm h(-)). The SDRs can be used to estimate sediment yield, which is an essential element for making land management decisions but is rarely measured."," Copyright (C) 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Singh, HV|Panuska, J|Thompson, AM",LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT,watershed upland area hillslope receiving waters terraces,10.1002/ldr.2727

Total strain energy and the maximum stress in the design domain were taken as the objective functions. After taking the thermal loading effect into account, the total strain energy density function became a nonhomogeneous function of the strain. In addition, temperature variation changed Hooke's law from a linear homogeneous to a linear nonhomogeneous expression including a zero order term. We derived the sensitivity value of the selected objective functions with respect to a perturbation in the structural domain under mechanical and thermal loads while considering these changes in the governing equations. We performed several numerical optimization problems to demonstrate the validity of the present level-set based Pareto topology optimization.

Soil sampling was conducted at two fields in Japan in . At the Ibaraki field (Andosol, clay loam), three, tillage practices (no-tillage, plowing to  cm, and rotary tillage to  cm) and three types of winter cover cropping [bare fallow as control, hairy vetch (Vicia villosa Roth), and rye (Secale cereale L.)] were conducted from  to . At the Hokkaido field (Fluvisol, light clay), two tillage practices (autumn tillage and rotary tillage with a rotary tiller to a depth of  cm once in autumn and twice in a year, respectively), and four types of winter cover cropping (bare fallow, hairy vetch, bristle oat (Avena strigosa L.), and a mixture of hairy vetch and bristle oat) were conducted from  to . Soil microbial activities and the fungal-to-bacterial activity ratio (FIB ratio) were estimated by the substrate-induced respiration (SIR) method with the use of selective antibiotics. At the Ibaraki field, rye cover cropping showed higher microbial SIR than bare fallow at depths of - cm and rotary tillage maintained higher microbial SIR than no-tillage or plowing at depths of .-. cm. There was no meaningful interaction effect between cover cropping and tillage on microbial SIR. At the Hokkaido field, cover cropping and tillage had only limited effects on microbial SIR. High FIB ratios (indicating fungal dominance) were recorded with the use of cover crops in both fields. Fungal SIR, estimated from the microbial SIR and FIB ratio, was closely related to the content of total soil organic carbon (SOC) and the mean weight diameter (MWD) of water-stable aggregates. Based on SOC, fungal SIR was significantly higher under rye cover cropping. The relationship between fungal SIR and MWD was affected by tillage. We conclude that rye cover cropping and rotary tillage were very effective in increasing fungal SIR, SOC, and MWD in the Ibaraki soil.

Soil water monitoring was conducted in cooperation with the USDA Snake River Plain Water Quality Demonstration Project.

The classical design of experiments (DOE)-based approach that is motivated from statistics (for physical experiments) is one of the possible approaches for the evaluation of the component response with respect to design parameters [Myers, Montgomery. Response surface methodology, process and product optimization using design of experiments. John Wiley and Sons, NY ()]. As the underlying physical model used for the component response is deterministic and understood through a computer simulation model, one needs to re-think the use of the classical DOE techniques for this class of problems. In this paper, we explore an alternate sensitivity-analysis-based technique where a deterministic parametric response is constructed using exact derivatives of the complex finite-element (FE)-based computer models to design parameters. The method is based on a discrete sensitivity analysis formulation using semi-automatic differentiation (Griewank, SIAM (), ADIFOR, Automatic Differentiation of FORTRAN codes http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/autodiff/ ADIFOR/) to compute the Taylor series or its Pade equivalent for finite-element-based responses. Shape design or optimization in the context of finite element modeling is challenging because the evaluation of the response for different shape requires the need for a meshing consistent with the new geometry.

First, the model is mathematically formulated to determine the probability of reaching the maximum state of the sediment carrying capacity, and the mean time spent in transient states before reaching the maximum sediment carrying capacity. Experimental data are used to model the sediment movement process given the bed-load and the suspended load particles in the water column. The impact of different parameters is discussed under varying flow conditions and varying sediment particle characteristics. The model shows that, as the maximum number of particles increases, the probability that the flow can carry the particles decreases. A smaller particle size is normally associated with a higher probability of reaching the maximum sediment carrying capacity under the same flow condition. It is also found that as the time a particle spends in the water column increases, the probability of the flow maintaining the same number of particles after several sediment particle transitions into different states increases. In the second case study, the effective risk of a given number of sediment particles in the water column reaching the maximum capacity of the water treatment plant in the Shihmen Reservoir Basin in  is modeled. The Xia Yun hydrologic station is selected for the simulation because it is a fully comprehensive hydrologic station and is located near the Shihmen Reservoir.

Through the investigation on the sensitivity of model output parameters to the input parameters, sensitivity analysis (SA) has been proved to be able to identify the key sources of uncertainties and be helpful to reduce the model uncertainties. However, some input parameters with discrete values (e.g., land use type and soil type) and the regional effect of the sensitive parameters were rarely examined in SA. In this paper, taking the Zoige Plateau as a case area, we combined the one-factor-at-a-time (OAT) with Extended Fourier Amplitude Sensitivity Test (EFAST) to conduct a SA of DNDC for simulating the regional carbon budget, including Gross Primary Productivity (GPP), Net Primary Productivity (NPP), Net Ecosystem Productivity (NEP), autotrophic respiration (Ra), soil microbial heterotrophic respiration (Rh) and ecosystem respiration (Re). The result showed that the combination of OAT and EFAST could test the contribution of the input parameters with discrete values to the output parameters. In DNDC model, land use type and soil type had a significant impact on the regional carbon budget of the Zoige Plateau, and daily temperature was also confirmed to be one of the most important parameters for carbon budget. For the other input parameters, with the change of land use type or soil type at regional scale, the sensitive parameters of carbon budget would vary accordingly. The SA results would provide scientific evidence to optimize DNDC model and they suggested that we should pay attention to the spatial/temporal effect of SA and try to use the appropriate data in simulation of the regional carbon budget.",,"Wang, JY|Li, AN|Jin, HA",JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE,sensitivity analysis oat efast dndc model carbon budget zoige plateau,10.1007/s11629-015-3520-z

Soil microbial populations were characterized using a modified most probable number (MPN) method to determine quantitative shifts in heterotrophic and phenanthrene degrader communities while principal component analysis (PCA) of fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) data from isolated phenanthrene degraders was used to identify qualitative differences and degrader community diversity. The average heterotrophic bacterial population over time was about three times larger in rhizosphere soil than in bulk soil while phenanthrene degrading populations increased by as much as an order of magnitude between  and  days after planting (DAP). Thus, phenanthrene degraders were selectively enriched in rhizosphere soil compared with bulk soil.

The random field represented by the Karhunen-Loeve (KL) expansion is then directly incorporated into both the equilibrium equation of the SBFEM and its sensitivity analysis formulation. The perturbation method is employed to calculate the statistical moments of the structural responses and a semi-analytical sensitivity analysis method is used to efficiently calculate the gradients involved.

Here we describe one such GHM, the Macro-scale-Probability-Distributed Moisture model.  (Mac-PDM.). The model has undergone a number of revisions since it was last applied in the hydrological literature. This paper serves to provide a detailed description of the latest version of the model. The main revisions include the following: () the ability for the model to be run for n repetitions, which provides more robust estimates of extreme hydrological behaviour, () the ability of the model to use a gridded field of coefficient of variation (CV) of daily rainfall for the stochastic disaggregation of monthly precipitation to daily precipitation, and () the model can now be forced with daily input climate data as well as monthly input climate data. We demonstrate the effects that each of these three revisions has on simulated runoff relative to before the revisions were applied. Importantly, we show that when Mac-PDM.  is forced with monthly input data, it results in a negative runoff bias relative to when daily forcings are applied, for regions of the globe where the day-to-day variability in relative humidity is high. The runoff bias can be up to -% for a small selection of catchments but the absolute magnitude of the bias may be small. As such, we recommend future applications of Mac-PDM.  that use monthly climate forcings acknowledge the bias as a limitation of the model. The performance of Mac-PDM.  is evaluated by validating simulated runoff against observed runoff for  catchments.

This dynamic is especially distinct in high mountains areas, where topography, snow cover, micro-climate, vegetation, soil properties and land cover vary across short distances. For such areas, soil moisture modelling on a fine scale is therefore particularly challenging. We evaluated the distributed, physically based model WaSiM-ETH with regard to its ability to model soil moisture in high mountain catchments, including spatio-temporal patterns. The study was performed in the alpine catchment area of the Lotschen valley ( km()) in Switzerland, an area ranging from  to  m a.s.l. The model was run for the period of - with high temporal (hourly) and spatial ( m) resolution. Extensive TDR- and FD-measurements conducted in  and  enabled the validation of the simulated soil moisture. A local sensitivity analysis indicated a dependence of soil moisture on skeleton fraction and temperature. The validation results showed that WaSiM-ETH is able to simulate absolute soil moisture variability across different altitudes and land cover types with only a moderate accuracy (R = .), whereas the soil moisture dynamic is reproduced well (R = ., IoA = .). High spatial variability of skeleton fraction and coarse meteorological data are the main causes for the limitation in soil moisture modelling. Nevertheless, analysing the spatio-temporal patterns of soil moisture revealed a clear seasonal pattern that is in line with literature. We found soil moisture to be determined by liquid precipitation, snow-melt and evapotranspiration. Greatest efforts should be laid on the exact determination of fine-scale meteorological data and spatial skeleton estimation to improve soil moisture modelling in high mountain areas in the future."," Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Rossler, O|Loffler, J",HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,hydrological modelling soil moisture wasim-eth sensitivity analysis swiss alps,10.1002/hyp.7663

Therefore, the objective of the study was to investigate the impact of the interactions of soil permeability, vegetation rooting depth and growth duration on drainage in  sites in northern New South Wales, Australia. Local sensitivity analysis was used on drainage estimated by two biophysical models-WaterMod , with a crop growth module, and HYDRUS-D without a crop growth module. The effect of saturated hydraulic conductivity (K(s)), growth duration (GD), rooting depth (RD), annual rainfall, and their interactions on deep drainage was evaluated at  sites. Simulations were conducted using  years of randomly selected climate data from  years historical data. Rainfall variability was similar in all  sites, so annual rainfall was the dominant factor dictating drainage in all  rainfall-years whereas GD was more important than RD after accounting for rainfall and drainage was least sensitive to K,. The minor impact of RD was ascribed to the soil water content being at the lower extraction limit of crops due to potential evaporation being greater than rainfall in almost all months of the rainfall-year. The importance of CD varied between rainfall-years and sites, and was generally higher at high annual rainfall. We conclude that the level of precision at which model inputs are defined would vary with annual rainfall level. Therefore, CD could be defined on a rough scale in low rainfall zones, whereas more precise definitions are necessary at high rainfall.

At the oxic/anoxic interface (OAT) of hyporheic zones subjected to redox oscillations, VC is degraded via coexisting aerobic ethenotrophic and anaerobic reductive dechlorination pathways. However, the identity of aerobic VC degradation pathways (cometabolic vs metabolic) and their interactions with reductive dechlorination in relation to riverbed sediment geochemistry remain ill-defined. We addressed this using microcosms containing OAT sediments incubated under fluctuating oxic/anoxic atmosphere. Under oxic atmosphere, aerobic metabolic VC oxidation was absent in sediments with high total organic carbon (TOC) and VC was reductively dechlorinated to ethene. Ethene was oxidized by ethenotrophs that can degrade VC cometabolically. Contrastingly, VC was metabolically oxidized by ethenotrophs in low-TOC sediments with low reductive dechlorination potential. Accordingly, enrichment and isolation of metabolic VC-oxidizing ethenotrophs was successful only from the low-TOC sediment. Sequence analysis of etnE genes from the microcosms as well phylogenetic typing of the isolates showed that ethenotrophs in the sediments were facultative anaerobic Proteobacteria capable of coping with OAT-associated redox fluctuations.

A two-dimensional (D) algae dynamic model for Meiliang Bay in Taihu Lake was developed using DelftD-BLOOM based on the D hydrodynamic result gained from DelftD-FLOW and was calibrated by data collected from four stations within the bay from  to . The study selected  parameters that directly affected the growth, mortality and respiration of blue-green algae, green algae and freshwater diatoms, and investigated their sensitivity on model results. Due to the nonlinearity and large computational load, Morris screening was employed to carry out sensitivity analysis. Different level numbers p and sampling numbers r for Morris screening were examined. A final rank of influential parameters was obtained by averaging the sensitivity measurements of different p values. This study provides a potential guide for applications of the BLOOM model in fresh water lakes. In addition, Morris screening was proved an efficient and reliable approach to identify sensitive parameters from a large parameter set of numerical eutrophication models and thus improve the efficiency of model configuration.

In the present study, randomly amplified polymorphic DNA technology was applied to evaluate the genotoxic effects of wastewater (treated and raw) irrigation on oat plants (Avena sativa). RAPID profiles obtained showed that both treated and raw wastewater (RWW) were having genotoxic effects on oat plants. This was apparent by the appearance/disappearance of bands in the treatments compared with the control plants. From the  primers used,  bands were obtained with an average of . bands per primer. Irrigating plants with RWW caused  new bands to appear and  to disappear. Treated wastewater (TWW) caused only  new bands and the loss of  bands. This makes TWW less genotoxic than RWW. The Euclidean distances shown on the dendrogram, revealed the presence of two clusters according to dissimilarity values. One cluster contained the control plants and those irrigated with TWW, whereas the second contained the plants irrigated with RWW.

Moreover, an ideal index should be comparable to yields of crops. A vegetative experiment with  replications was set up on two soils: loamy sand and sandy loam, which had been polluted with cadmium, copper and zinc. Once the soil moisture content was raised to the level of % capillary water retention capacity, the following plants were sown: oat, spring oilseed rape and yellow lupine. Twice during the growing season, the activity of soil enzymes such as dehydrogenases, catalase, urease, B-glucosidase, acid phosphatase, alkaline phosphatase and arylsulphatase was determined. Next, based on the soil enzymatic activity as well as the content of clay and organic carbon,  indices of the biochemical soil activity (BAI to BAD.) were proposed, which were divided into two groups: simple and complex ones. In addition, coefficients of correlation between yields of plants and biochemical soil quality indices were calculated. The experiment has demonstrated that the activity of enzymes should be expressed in units of the product of a catalyzed reaction in  h time calculated per  kg d.m. of soil, i.e. the activity of dehydrogenases in emol TFF, catalase - mol O-, alkaline phosphatase and arylsulphatase - mmol PNP, while that of urease in mmol N-NH+. Introduction of uniform units facilitates comparison of the results and quality assessment of different soils, irrespective of the author or research centre they originate from. It has also been shown that among the  tested biochemical indices of soil quality assessment, the best ones are BA() = %C x (Deh + Pal + Pac + Ure), derived from the content of organic carbon and activity of four enzymes: dehydrogenase, alkaline phosphatase, acid phosphatase and urease, and BA() = Deh + Kat + Pal + Pac + Tire + Glu + Aryl, calculated from the activity of seven enzymes: dehydrogenases (Deh), catalase (Cat), acid phosphatase (Pac), alkaline phosphatase (Pal), urease (Ure), beta-glucosidase (glu) and arylsulphatase (Aryl).",,"Wyszkowska, J|Borowik, A|Kucharski, M|Kucharski, J",JOURNAL OF ELEMENTOLOGY,cadmium copper zinc soil enzymes biochemical index of soil quality,10.5601/jelem.2013.18.4.504

An essential step towards developing new practices is a good understanding of long-term, or ""baseline"", nitrate leaching into tile drainage water,,both with and without annual application of nitrogen fertilizer. Accordingly, an automated monitoring system was installed to measure nitrate levels in tile drainage water from experimental plots on a Brookston clay loam soil in southwestern Ontario that have had consistent agricultural management for  years. Crops included conventionally tilled continuous corn (CC, Zea mays L.), continuous bluegrass sod (Poa pratensis L.) and a corn-oat (Avena sativa L.)-alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.)-alfalfa rotation with all four crops of the rotation present each year. Fertilized and not-fertilized phases were included with each of the six crops to give a total of  treatments. Measurements included precipitation, tile discharge, corn yield and nitrate concentration and total nitrate loss in tile drainage water. The fertilized CC, fertilized rotation corn and second year fertilized alfalfa treatments produced -year flow weighted mean (FWM) nitrate concentrations in tile drainage water of ., . and . mg N l(-), respectively, all of which exceed the Canadian and European drinking water guideline values of  and . mg N l(-), respectively. The -year cumulative nitrate losses were high at . kg N ha(-) for fertilized CC, . kg N ha(-) for fertilized rotation corn and . kg N ha(-) for second year fertilized alfalfa. Given that the existing fertilizer recommendations are required to achieve economic corn yields, these results indicate that current corn production practices on Brookston clay loam can potentially cause nitrate pollution of the rural environment, as well as substantial economic loss to corn producers through inefficient crop use of applied nitrogen fertilizer. There is consequently a need for new agricultural practices that can increase the nitrogen use efficiency of corn production and minimize nitrate loss to the environment.", (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

RAINBOW-TROUT TISSUE DISTRIBUTION FATTY-ACIDS PERFLUOROCARBOXYLIC ACIDS,"Perfluorinated alkyl acids (PFAAs) are important global pollutants with unique pharmacokinetics. Evidence is accumulating that their behavior within organisms is affected by interaction with a number of proteins. In mammals, serum albumin, fatty acid binding proteins (FABPs) and organic anion transporters (OATs) have been identified as important to the tissue distribution, species specific accumulation, and species- and gender-specific elimination rates of perfluoroalkyl carboxylates and perfluoroalkane sulfonates. Similar pharmacokinetics has been identified in fish. Yet, no mechanistic model exists for the bioaccumulation of PFAAs in fish that explicitly considers protein interactions In this work, we present the first mechanistic protein binding bioconcentration model for PFAAs in fish. Our model considers PFAA uptake via passive diffusion at the gills, association with serum albumin in the circulatory and extracellular spaces, association with FABP in the liver, and renal elimination and reabsorption facilitated by OAT proteins The model is evaluated using measured bioconcentration and tissue distribution data collected in two previous studies of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and common carp (Cyprinus carpio). Comparing our model with previous attempts to describe PFAA bioconcentration using a nonspecific (partitioning-type) approach shows that inclusion of protein interactions is key to accurately predicting tissue specific PFAA distribution and bioconcentration.",,"Ng, CA|Hungerbuhler, K",ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY,,10.1021/es400981a

Development of management practices to reduce these emissions would have a significant impact on greenhouse gas levels. Non-leguminous cover crops are efficient scavengers of residual soil NO, thereby reducing leaching losses. However, the effect of a grass cover crop on NO emissions from soil receiving liquid swine manure has not been evaluated. This study investigated: (i) the temporal patterns of NO emissions following addition of swine manure slurry in a laboratory setting under fluctuating soil moisture regimes; (ii) assessed the potential of a rye (Secale cereale L.) cover crop to decrease NO emissions under these conditions: and (iii) quantified field NO emissions in response to either spring applied urea ammonium nitrate (UAN) or different rates of fall-applied liquid swine manure, in the presence or absence of a rye/oat winter cover crop. Laboratory experiments investigating cover crop effects NO emissions were performed in a controlled environment chamber programmed fora  h light period,  degrees C day temperature, and  degrees C night temperature. Treatments with or without a living rye cover crop were treated with either: (i) no manure: (ii) a phosphorus-based manure application rate (low manure): or (iii) a nitrogen-based manure application rate (high manure). We observed a significant reduction in NO emissions in the presence of the rye cover crop. Field experiments were performed on a fine-loamy soil in Central Iowa from October ,  to October , . We observed no significant effect of the cover crop on cumulative NO emissions in the field. The primary factor influencing NO emission was N application rate, regardless of form or timing. The response of NO emission to N additions was non-linear, with progressively more NO emitted with increasing N application.

This paper presents the analysis of VOC measurements collected indoors and outdoors for  students' homes in NYC and for  students' homes in LA across two seasons. Dual-sorbent thermal desorption tubes were used for the collection of  VOCs and C- ,-dinitrophenylhydrazine-coated cartridges were used for the collection of seven aldehydes. Air-exchange rates (AERs) were also measured using a perfluorocarbon tracer gas method. The AERs were lower in the winter in both cities, averaging  h(-) in NYC and . h(-) in LA, compared with . h(-) in NYC in the summer and . h(-) in LA in the fall. Higher AERs were generally associated with lower indoor-outdoor ratios with significant differences for the compounds with indoor sources, including chloroform, ,-dichlorobenzene, and formaldehyde. Using a mass-balance model to account for AER and other housing parameters, effective source emission rates (SER) were calculated for each compound. Based on I/O ratios and source emission rates, VOCs could be divided into: () indoor-source-influenced compounds, () those with contributions from both indoor and outdoor sources, and () those with mostly outdoor sources. Significant indoor sources were found for the following six compounds ( mean emission rates presented): chloroform (. mg/h), ,-dichlorobenzene ( mg/h), formaldehyde ( mg/h), acetaldehyde ( mg/h), benzaldehyde (. mg/h), and hexaldehyde ( mg/h).

As the number of parameters increases, algorithmic parameter studies such as optimization and uncertainty quantification require many more model evaluations. One way to combat this curse of dimensionality is to seek an alternative parameterization with fewer variables that produces comparable predictions. The active subspace is a low-dimensional linear subspace defined by important directions in the model's input space; input perturbations along these directions change the model's prediction more, on average, than perturbations orthogonal to the important directions. We describe a method for checking if a model admits an exploitable active subspace and apply this method to a single-diode solar cell model with five input parameters. We find that the maximum power of the solar cell has a dominant one-dimensional active subspace, which enables us to perform thorough parameter studies in one dimension instead of five.",,"Constantine, PG|Zaharatos, B|Campanelli, M",STATISTICAL ANALYSIS AND DATA MINING,single-diode solar cell model active subspaces dimension reduction parameterized simulations,10.1002/sam.11281

The most popular SA practice seen in the literature is that of 'one-factor-at-a-time' (OAT). This consists of analyzing the effect of varying one model input factor at a time while keeping all other fixed. While the shortcomings of OAT are known from the statistical literature, its widespread use among modelers raises concern on the quality of the associated sensitivity analyses. The present paper introduces a novel geometric proof of the inefficiency of OAT, with the purpose of providing the modeling community with a convincing and possibly definitive argument against OAT. Alternatives to OAT are indicated which are based on statistical theory, drawing from experimental design, regression analysis and sensitivity analysis proper. (C) ", Elsevier Ltd.

The catchment land use is mostly plantation forest, some of which is spray-irrigated with treated wastewater. A Sequential Uncertainty Fitting (SUFI-) procedure was used to auto-calibrate unknown parameter values in the SWAT model. Model validation was performed using two data sets: () monthly instantaneous measurements of suspended sediment (SS), total phosphorus (TP) and total nitrogen (TN) concentrations; and () high-frequency ( h) data measured during rainfall events. Monthly instantaneous TP and TN concentrations were generally not reproduced well (% bias for TP, % bias for TN, and R- <., NSE < for both TP and TN), in contrast to SS concentrations (<% bias; R- and NSE both >.) during model validation. Comparison of simulated daily mean SS, TP and TN concentrations with daily mean discharge-weighted high-frequency measurements during storm events indicated that model predictions during the high rainfall period considerably underestimated concentrations of SS (% bias) and TP (% bias), while TN concentrations were comparable (<% bias; R- and NSE both similar to .). This comparison highlighted the potential for model error associated with quick flow fluxes in flashy lower-order streams to be underestimated compared with low-frequency (e.g. monthly) measurements derived predominantly from base flow measurements. To address this, we recommend that high-frequency, event-based monitoring data are used to support calibration and validation. Simulated discharge, SS, TP and TN loads were partitioned into two components (base flow and quick flow) based on hydrograph separation. A manual procedure (one-at-a-time sensitivity analysis) was used to quantify parameter sensitivity for the two hydrologically separated regimes. Several SWAT parameters were found to have different sensitivities between base flow and quick flow. Parameters relating to main channel processes were more sensitive for the base flow estimates, while those relating to overland processes were more sensitive for the quick flow estimates. This study has important implications for identifying uncertainties in parameter sensitivity and performance of hydrological models applied to catchments with large fluctuations in stream flow and in cases where models are used to examine scenarios that involve substantial changes to the existing flow regime.",,"Me, W|Abell, JM|Hamilton, DP",HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES,,10.5194/hess-19-4127-2015
