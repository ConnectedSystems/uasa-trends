While there are a number of existing physical models of forest interception, few studies have summarized or compared these models. The objective of this work is to use global sensitivity and uncertainty analysis to compare five mechanistic interception models including the Rutter, Rutter Sparse, Gash, Sparse Gash, and Liu models. Using parameter probability distribution functions of values from the literature, our results show that on average storm duration [Dur], gross precipitation [PG], canopy storage [S] and solar radiation [Rn] are the most important model parameters. On the other hand, empirical parameters used in calculating evaporation and drip (i.e. trunk evaporation as a proportion of evaporation from the saturated canopy [e], the empirical drainage parameter [b], the drainage partitioning coefficient [pd], and the rate of water dripping from the canopy when canopy storage has been reached [Ds]) have relatively low levels of importance in interception modeling. As such, future modeling efforts should aim to decompose parameters that are the most influential in determining model outputs into easily measurable physical components. Because this study compares models, the choices regarding the parameter probability distribution functions are applied across models, which enables a more definitive ranking of model uncertainty.", (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This study investigated GHG emissions during MSW landfilling in China under four existing scenarios and in terms of seven different categories: waste collection and transportation, landfill management, leachate treatment, fugitive CH (FM) emissions, substitution of electricity production, carbon sequestration and NO and CO emissions. GHG emissions from simple sanitary landfilling technology where no landfill gas (LFG) extraction took place (Scenario ) were higher (- kg CO-eq-t(-)ww) than those from open dump (Scenario , - kg CO-eq.t(-)ww). This was due to the strictly anaerobic conditions in Scenario . LFG collection and treatment reduced GHG emissions to - kg CO-eq.t(-)ww in Scenario  (with LFG flare) and - kg CO-eq.t(-)ww in Scenario  (using LFG for electricity production). Amongst the seven categories, FM was the predominant contributor to GHG emissions. Global sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the parameters associated with waste characteristics (i.e. CH potential and carbon sequestered faction) and LFG management (i.e. LFG collection efficiency and CH oxidation efficiency) were of great importance. A further learning on the MSW in China indicated that water content and dry matter content of food waste were the basic factors affecting GHG emissions. Source separation of food waste, as well as increasing the incineration ratio of mixed collected MSW, could effectively mitigate the overall GHG emissions from landfilling in a specific city. To increase the LFG collection and CH oxidation efficiencies could considerably reduce GHG emissions on the landfill site level. While, the improvement in the LFG utilization measures had an insignificant impact as long as the LFG is recovered for energy generation. (C) ", Elsevier Ltd.

This paper develops a systematic error quantification methodology for computational models. Some types of errors are deterministic, and some are stochastic. Appropriate procedures are developed to either correct the model prediction for deterministic errors or to account for the stochastic errors through sampling. First, input error, discretization error in finite element analysis (FEA), surrogate model error, and output measurement error are considered. Next, uncertainty quantification error, which arises due to the use of sampling-based methods, is also investigated. Model form error is estimated based on the comparison of corrected model prediction against physical observations and after accounting for solution approximation errors, uncertainty quantification errors, and experimental errors (input and output). Both local and global sensitivity measures are investigated to estimate and rank the contribution of each source of error to the uncertainty in the final result. Two numerical examples are used to demonstrate the proposed methodology by considering mechanical stress analysis and fatigue crack growth analysis.",,"Liang, B|Mahadevan, S",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR UNCERTAINTY QUANTIFICATION,error quantification uncertainty quantification sensitivity analysis finite elements discretization surrogate model,10.1615/IntJUncertaintyQuantification.v1.i2.30

Several methodological difficulties emerging from uncertainty quantification in decision-making are identified. The review is focused on formal methods of multiple criteria decision-making (MCDM). Handling of uncertainty by means of fuzzy logic and probabilistic modelling is analysed in light of MCDM. A sensitivity analysis of MCDM problems with uncertainties is discussed. An application of stochastic MCDM methods to a design of safety critical objects of civil engineering is considered. Prospects of using MCDM under uncertainty in developing areas of civil engineering are discussed in brief. These areas are design of sustainable and energy efficient buildings, building information modelling, and assurance of security and safety of built property. It is stated that before long the decision-making in civil engineering may face several methodological problems: the need to combine fuzzy and probabilistic representations of uncertainties in one decision-making matrix, the necessity to extend a global sensitivity analysis to all input elements of a MCDM problem with uncertainties, and an application of MCDM methods in the areas of civil engineering where decision-making under uncertainty is presently not common.",,"Antucheviciene, J|Kala, Z|Marzouk, M|Vaidogas, ER",MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING,,10.1155/2015/362579

All these factors can give rise to large-scale anomalous dispersive behavior that can make complex model representation and prediction of plume concentrations challenging due to difficulties unraveling all the complexities associated with the governing processes, flow medium, and their parameters. An alternative is to use upscaled stochastic models of anomalous dispersion, and this is the approach used here. Within a probabilistic framework, we derive a number of analytical solutions for several anomalous dispersion models. The anomalous dispersion models are allowed to be either non-Gaussian (alpha-stable Levy), correlated, or nonstationary from the Lagrangian perspective. A global sensitivity analysis is performed to gain a greater understanding of the extent to which uncertainty in the parameters associated with the anomalous behavior can be narrowed by examining concentration measurements from a network of monitoring wells and to demonstrate the computational speed of the solutions. The developed analytical solutions are encoded and available for use in the open source computational framework MADS (http://mads.lanl.gov).", Published by Elsevier Ltd.,"O'Malley, D|Vesselinov, VV",ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES,anomalous dispersion stochastic transport analytical solutions,10.1016/j.advwatres.2014.02.006

S. Army Corps of Engineers and has been used for flood protection in some large rivers. In its use for the real-time management of levee and drainage districts for flood protection, such as on the Mississippi River Basin, the required number of simulations for combinations of scenarios would present a great challenge for modelers to provide data for operational-mode decision making. The goal of this paper is to identify the most sensitive parameters for the spillway, simple levee failure, and complicated levee failure options in UNET so that simulations for real-time operation can focus on the most sensitive parameters without sacrificing much modeling accuracy. The sensitivity analysis was performed for the -year frequency flood in the lower Illinois River during which the Thompson Lake Levee and Drainage District or the Emiquon Area were used as temporary flood storage by using a state-of-the-art variance-based sensitivity analysis method-extended Fourier amplitude sensitivity test (FAST). The first-order and total-effect sensitivity indexes computed from the FAST method were used to evaluate the affect of the parameters to flood-peak reduction. As a result, the least and most sensitive variables for the spillway, simple levee failure, and complicated levee failure options in UNET were identified, and this knowledge helps significantly reduce the number of simulations for management scenarios by focusing on only the most sensitive parameters.

The sensitivity of simulated flash floods to convective rain-cell characteristics is examined for an extreme storm event over a  km() semi-arid catchment in southern Israel. High space-time resolution weather radar data were used to derive and model convective rain cells that then served as input into a hydrological model. Based on alterations of location, direction and speed of a major rain cell, identified as the flooding cell for this case, the impacts on catchment rainfall and generated flood were examined. Global sensitivity analysis was applied to identify the most important factors affecting the flash flood peak discharge at the catchment outlet. We found that the flood peak discharge could be increased three-fold by relatively small changes in rain-cell characteristics.

The direction of change in emissions, effluent quality and operational cost resulting from variation of control handles individually is determined using one-factor-at-a-time sensitivity analysis, and corresponding trade-offs are identified. The contribution of each control handle to variance in model outputs, taking into account the effects of interactions, is then explored using a variance-based sensitivity analysis method, i.e., Sobol's method, and significant second order interactions are discovered. This knowledge will assist future control strategy development and aid an efficient design and optimisation process, as it provides a better understanding of the effects of control handles on key performance indicators and identifies those for which dynamic control has the greatest potential benefits. Sources with the greatest variance in emissions, and therefore the greatest need to monitor, are also identified. It is found that variance in total emissions is predominantly due to changes in direct NO emissions and selection of suitable values for wastage flow rate and aeration intensity in the final activated sludge reactor is of key importance. To improve effluent quality, costs and/or emissions, it is necessary to consider the effects of adjusting multiple control handles simultaneously and determine the optimum trade-off.

This influent model is part of the Benchmark Simulation Model (BSM) family and creates realistic dry/wet weather files describing diurnal, weekend and seasonal variations through the combination of different generic model blocks, i.e. households, industry, rainfall and infiltration. The GSA is carried out by combining Monte Carlo simulations and standardized regression coefficients (SRC). Cluster analysis is then applied, classifying the influence of the model parameters into strong, medium and weak. The results show that the method is able to decompose the variance of the model predictions (R- > .) satisfactorily, thus identifying the model parameters with strongest impact on several flow rate descriptors calculated at different time resolutions. Catchment size (PE) and the production of wastewater per person equivalent (QperPE) are two parameters that strongly influence the yearly average dry weather flow rate and its variability. Wet weather conditions are mainly affected by three parameters: () the probability of occurrence of a rain event (Llrain); () the catchment size, incorporated in the model as a parameter representing the conversion from mm rain . day(-) to m() . day(-) (Qpermm); and, () the quantity of rain falling on permeable areas (aH). The case study also shows that in both dry and wet weather conditions the SRC ranking changes when the time scale of the analysis is modified, thus demonstrating the potential to identify the effect of the model parameters on the fast/medium/slow dynamics of the flow rate. The paper ends with a discussion on the interpretation of GSA results and of the advantages of using synthetic dynamic flow rate data for WWTP influent scenario generation. This section also includes general suggestions on how to use the proposed methodology to any influent generator to adapt the created time series to a modeller's demands.",,"Flores-Alsina, X|Gernaey, KV|Jeppsson, U",WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY,activated sludge modelling benchmarking bsm influent modelling monte carlo simulations standardized regression coefficients (src),10.2166/wst.2012.089

However, considerable uncertainty may exist when upscaling a simulation from the plot scale to a larger scale because of variation in the model inputs. The objectives of this study were to assess the uncertainty of CENTURY-modeled SOC and to identify the most influential model inputs in various upland regions of China. Materials and methods Global sensitivity analysis was used to explore the sensitivity of CENTURY-modeled SOC to seven key model inputs. The uncertainties of the SOC simulated using various model inputs and climate-soil-management conditions were evaluated at  long-term monitoring sites located across upland areas in China. Results and discussion The identified sensitive model inputs differed among regions and periods due to diverse climate-soil-management conditions; nevertheless, initial SOC content (SOCi), soil clay content, and crop residue removal rate (Residue(rr)) were the most influential inputs. The site-to-region upscaling uncertainties remained moderately large (+/- ., +/- ., and +/- . % at the , , and  % confidence levels, respectively) when currently available observation data were used. Therefore, the collection of detailed information on soil properties and crop residue removal, particularly legacy soil data such as the SOCi and clay content, is important for reducing the uncertainties in SOC modeling.

Numerical modeling of such sites is an important tool for a correct prediction of contamination plume spreading and an assessment of environmental risks associated with the site. Many uncertainties are associated with a part of the parameters and the initial conditions of such environmental numerical models. Statistical techniques are useful to deal with these uncertainties. This paper describes the methods of uncertainty propagation and global sensitivity analysis that are applied to a numerical model of radionuclide migration in a sandy aquifer in the area of the RRC ""Kurchatov Institute"" radwaste disposal site in Moscow, Russia. We consider  uncertain input parameters of the model and  output variables (contaminant concentration in the observation wells predicted by the model for the end of ). Monte Carlo simulations allow calculating uncertainty in the output values and analyzing the linearity and the monotony of the relations between input and output variables. For the non monotonic relations, sensitivity analyses are classically done with the Sobol sensitivity indices. The originality of this study is the use of modern surrogate models (called response surfaces), the boosting regression trees, constructed for each output variable, to calculate the Sobol indices by the Monte Carlo method. It is thus shown that the most influential parameters of the model are distribution coefficients and infiltration rate in the zone of strong pipe leaks on the site.

Global sensitivity analysis (GSA) approach is based on the variance based method incorporating Random Sampling-High Dimensional Model Representation (RS-HDMR) expansion in which component functions are determined by diffeomorphic modulation under observable response preserving homotopy (D-MORPH) regression. The advantage of the D-MORPH regression lies in its capability to solve linear algebraic equations with a limited number of sample points. The main purpose is to investigate the influence of fiber path, regarded as the design variable, on the formability and structural performance of FRCs. Wherein, spring-back and load-carrying capacity are two meaningful problems to be addressed. Two typical FRCs are included that an L-shaped part with straight fiber path using autoclave manufacturing process and a variable stiffness composite cylindrical shell under pure bending. The work not only focuses on the ranking of design variables but also hopes to find out their interactions represented by the second order global sensitivity indexes.

The change in the hydrological regime associated with the drainage of blanket peat is poorly understood, yet has perceived importance for flooding, low flows and water quality. We propose a new simplified physics-based model that allows the associated hydrological processes and flow responses to be explored. The model couples four one-dimensional models to represent a three-dimensional hillslope, allowing for the exploration of flow and water table response throughout the model domain for a range of drainage configurations and peat properties. The model is tested against a data set collected from Oughtershaw Beck, UK, with results showing good model performance for wet periods although less conformity with borehole observations during rewetting periods. A wider exploration of model behaviour indicates that the model is consistent with the hydrological response reported in the literature for a number of drained blanket peat sites, and therefore has potential to provide guidance to decision makers concerning the effects of management practices.

Numerical models, such as VFSMOD-W, offer a mechanistic approach for evaluating VFS effectiveness under various hydrological conditions including concentrated flow. This research hypothesizes that the presence of concentrated flow drastically alters the importance of various hydrological, sedimentological, and pesticide input factors and the prediction uncertainty of pesticide reduction. Using data from a VFS experimental field study investigating chlorpyrifos and atrazine transport, a two-step global sensitivity and uncertainty analysis framework was used with VFSMOD-W based on () a screening method (Morris) and () a variance-based method (extended Fourier Analysis Sensitivity Test, FAST). The vertical, saturated hydraulic conductivity was consistently the most important input factor for predicting infiltration, explaining % of total output variance for uniform sheet flow, but only % for concentrated flow. Sedimentation was governed by both hydrologic (vertical, saturated hydraulic conductivity and initial and saturated water content) and sediment characteristics (average particle diameter). The vertical, saturated hydraulic conductivity was the most important input factor for atrazine or chlorpyrifos trapping under uniform sheet flow (explained more than % of the total output variance) and concentrated flow (although only explained % of the total variance in this case). The % confidence intervals for atrazine and chlorpyrifos reduction ranged between % and % for uniform sheet flow and decreased to between % and % under concentrated flow. Concentrated flow increased interactions among the system components, enhancing the relative importance of processes that were latent under shallow flow conditions.

Current CEDO methods only consider observation errors and focus on problems with low-dimensional response variables. This paper proposes a new robust CEDO model for Bayesian calibration with field response and incorporates various sources of model uncertainty such as surrogate model uncertainty, numerical discretization error, and model discrepancy, into CEDO. Since sampling-based methods to estimate the posterior distributions and thus compute the objective function (information gain) are computationally expensive, this paper develops an analytical method to estimate the objective function while accounting for model uncertainty during this process. Based on the evaluation of objective function, a global sensitivity analysis (GSA)-based method is proposed to check the quality of surrogate models used in CEDO, guide the training and improvement of the surrogate models, and thus reduce the effect of surrogate model uncertainty on CEDO. The optimal experimental input settings are obtained using the efficient global optimization (EGO) method.

So far, mainly energy intensive physical and chemical unit processes have been developed to recover some of these resources, and less energy and resource demanding alternatives are needed. Here, we present a modified enhanced biological phosphorus removal and recovery system (referred to as EBPR) that can produce optimal culture media for downstream micro-algal growth in terms of N and P content. Phosphorus is recovered as a P-stream by diversion of some of the effluent from the upstream anaerobic reactor. By operating the process at comparably low solids retention times (SRT), the nitrogen content of wastewater is retained as free and saline ammonia, the preferred form of nitrogen for most micro-algae. Scenario simulations were carried out to assess the capacity of the EBPR system to produce nutrient rich organic-carbon depleted algal cultivation media of target composition. Via SRT control, the quality of the constructed cultivation media can be optimized to support a wide range of green micro-algal growth requirements. Up to % of the influent phosphorus can be recovered, by diverting % of the influent flow as a P-stream at an SRT of  days. Through global sensitivity analysis we find that the effluent N-to-P ratio and the P recovered are mainly dependent on the influent quality rather than on bioldnetics or stoichiometry. Further research is needed to demonstrate that the system performance predicted through the model-based design can be achieved in reality. (C) ", Elsevier Ltd.

The focus is on reducing the computational burden associated with the stochastic simulation through adaptive implementation of importance sampling (IS) across the iterations of the optimization algorithm. The proposed formulation relies only on available information (i.e., function evaluations) from the current iteration of the optimization process to improve estimation accuracy in subsequent iterations, and therefore corresponds to a IS selection with a small additional computational burden. Kernel density estimation (KDE) is employed to construct the IS densities based on samples distributed proportional to the integrand of the probabilistic performance. The characteristics of the proposal density are optimally selected to minimize the anticipated coefficient of variation for the objective function if such a proposal density is used as IS distribution. To avoid numerical problems that can occur when trying to develop IS for all uncertain model parameters, a prioritization is first performed using a recently proposed global sensitivity analysis to quantify the relative importance of each model parameter. Therefore, the IS density is only constructed for the most important parameters, with the exact number also a variable that is optimally selected based on the anticipated accuracy. To facilitate the overall adaptive scheme efficient guidelines for the sharing of information across iterations of the optimization algorithm are developed.

It is well known that MCR is NP-complete. Heuristic and approximate algorithms for MCR are not effective in dynamic network environment for real-time applications when the state information of the network is out of date. This paper presents a genetic algorithm to solve the MCR problem subject to transmission delay and transmission success ratio. Three key design problems are investigated for this new algorithm, i.e., how to encode the problem in genetic representation, how to avoid the illegal chromosomes in the process of population initialization and genetic operation, and how to design effective genetic operator. We propose the gene structure (GS) to deal with the first problem, and the gene structure algorithm (GSA) to generate the GS. Based on the GS, we provide the heuristic chromosome initialization and mutation operator to solve the last two problems. Computer simulations show that the proposed GA exhibits much faster computation speed so as to satisfy the real-time requirement, and much higher rate of convergence than other algorithms.

Modularity optimization is an interesting and valuable approach for detection of network communities in complex networks.

Fecal indicator organisms (FIOs) are commonly used for the microbial pollution level evaluation. Models predicting the fate and transport of FIOs are required to design and evaluate best management practices that reduce the microbial pollution in ecosystems and water sources and thus help to predict the risk of food and waterborne diseases. In this study we performed a sensitivity analysis for the KINEROS/STWIR model developed to predict the FIOs transport out of manured fields to other fields and water bodies in order to identify input variables that control the transport uncertainty. The distributions of model input parameters were set to encompass values found from three-year experiments at the USDA-ARS OPE experimental site in Beltsville and publicly available information. Sobol' indices and complementary regression trees were used to perform the global sensitivity analysis of the model and to explore the interactions between model input parameters on the proportion of FIO removed from fields. Regression trees provided a useful visualization of the differences in sensitivity of the model output in different parts of the input variable domain. Environmental controls such as soil saturation, rainfall duration and rainfall intensity had the largest influence in the model behavior, whereas soil and manure properties ranked lower. The field length had only moderate effect on the model output sensitivity to the model inputs. Among the manure-related properties the parameter determining the shape of the FIO release kinetic curve had the largest influence on the removal of FIOs from the fields. That underscored the need to better characterize the FIO release kinetics. Since the most sensitive model inputs are available in soil and weather databases or can be obtained using soil water models, results indicate the opportunity of obtaining large-scale estimates of FIO transport from fields based on publicly available rather than site-specific information.", Published by Elsevier Ltd,"Martinez, G|Pachepsky, YA|Whelan, G|Yakirevich, AM|Guber, A|Gish, TJ",ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL,fecal indicator organisms release and transport global sensitivity analysis regression trees,10.1016/j.envint.2013.11.003

Three nitrogen-models of varying hydrological complexity were considered. For each model, general sensitivity analysis (GSA) and Generalized Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation (GLUE) were applied, each based on , Monte Carlo simulations. The results highlighted the most complex structure as the most appropriate, providing the best representation of the non-linear patterns observed in the flow and streamwater nitrate concentrations between  and . Its % and % GLUE bounds, obtained considering a multi-objective approach, provide the narrowest band for streamwater nitrogen, which suggests increased model robustness, though all models exhibit periods of inconsistent good and poor fits between simulated outcomes and observed data. The results confirm the importance of the riparian zone in controlling the short-term (daily) streamwater nitrogen dynamics in this catchment but not the overall flux of nitrogen from the catchment. It was also shown that as the complexity of a hydrological model increases over-parameterisation occurs, but the converse is true for a water quality model where additional process representation leads to additional acceptable model simulations.

The objective of this manuscript is to hybridize local and global sensitivity analysis methods to enable the application of reduced order modeling to complex nonlinear models, often encountered in real system design and analysis calculations, for example, nuclear reactors. This is achieved by first employing local variational methods to identify important nonlinear features of the original model that are required to reach a user-defined accuracy for the reduced model. This information is obtained by sampling local first-order derivatives of a pseudoresponse utilizing a modified representation of an infinite series expansion around some reference point. The resulting derivative information is aggregated in a subspace of dimension much less than the dimension of the input parameter space. The accuracy of the reduced model can be mathematically quantified using a bounding norm. Next, global sensitivity methods are employed to exhaustively search the reduced subspace for sensitivity information. The theory and implementation details of the proposed method are exposed in this manuscript.

One-factor-at-a-time sensitivity analysis is used to screen model parameters and identify those with significant individual effects on three performance indicators: total greenhouse gas emissions, effluent quality and operational cost. Sobol's method enables identification of parameters with significant higher order effects and of particular parameter pairs to which model outputs are sensitive. Use of a variance-based global sensitivity analysis tool to investigate parameter interactions enables identification of important parameters not revealed in one-factor-at-a-time sensitivity analysis. These interaction effects have not been considered in previous studies and thus provide a better understanding wastewater treatment plant model characterisation.

The paramount problem in BSO is that it severely suffers from premature convergence problem, that is, BSO is easily trapped in local optima. In this paper, chaotic-based strategies are incorporated into BSO to mitigate this problem. Ergodicity and non-repetitious nature of chaotic functions can diversify the bats and mitigate premature convergence problem. Eleven different chaotic map functions along with various chaotic BSO strategies are investigated experimentally and the best one is chosen as the suitable chaotic strategy for BSO. The results of applying the proposed chaotic BSO to different benchmark functions vividly show that premature convergence problem has been mitigated efficiently.

For the purpose of identifying the influential distribution parameters, the parametric sensitivity of IM on the failure probability based on local and global sensitivity analysis technology is proposed. Then the definitions of the parametric sensitivities of IM on the failure probability are given, and their computational formulae are derived. The parametric sensitivity finds out how the IM can be changed by varying the distribution parameters, which provides an important reference to improve or modify the reliability properties. When the sensitivity indicator is larger, the basic distribution parameter becomes more important to the IM. Meanwhile, for the issue that the computational effort of the IM and its parametric sensitivity is usually too expensive, an active learning Kriging (ALK) solution is established in this study.

However both optimum parameter values and the fluxes of water through individual model components change significantly with the time-step used. Thus, such models should be used with caution in applications such as hydrograph separation or water quality studies that require the fluxes through individual flow routes through the model or which try to relate parameters to physical features of the catchment. To demonstrate this time-scale limitation, a parameter sensitivity analysis was performed on the lumped conceptual Soil Moisture Accounting and Routing with Groundwater component (SMARG) model for a  km() rural catchment in Ireland for a number of time-steps, flow regimes and evaluation metrics. A global sensitivity analysis method (Higher Dimensional Model Representation) showed that sensitivity indices vary greatly with time-step and evaluation metric. The sensitivity of parameters also varied for different flow regimes. Certain parameters' sensitivities remain fairly constant across both flow regimes and time-step, while others are very much regime or time-step dependent.

One important source of nitrate in the environment is due to wastewater treatment using Onsite Sewage Treatment and Disposal Systems (OSTDS) (a.k.a., septic systems). To facilitate water resources and environmental management, an ArcGIS-Based Nitrate Load Estimation Toolkit (ArcNLET) is developed to simulate nitrate transport and estimate nitrate load from septic systems and collocated fertilizer applications in groundwater to surface water bodies. It is a screening tool based on a simplified conceptual model of groundwater flow and nitrate transport. It is used in this study to estimate nitrate load from thousands of septic systems to surface water bodies in two neighborhoods located in Jacksonville, FL, USA, where nitrate due to septic systems is believed to be one of the reasons of nutrient enrichment and an isotope study indicates that denitrification is significant. A global sensitivity analysis is performed to identify critical parameters for model calibration, and the most critical parameter is the first-order decay coefficient used to simulate the denitrification process. Hydraulic conductivities at different soil zones have different levels of influence on simulated nitrate concentrations at different locations. By manually adjusting model parameters, simulated shapes of water table and nitrate concentration agree reasonably with average field observations, suggesting that ArcNLET is able to simulate spatial variability of field observations.

We use the sample entropy (SampEn) statistic to quantify a schedule's regularity for a population. We show how to tune an activity's regularity by adjusting SampEn, thereby making it possible to realistically design activities when creating a schedule.

Our results show that HS combined with global sensitivity analysis can efficiently tune the SampEn statistic with few search iterations.

This study uses global sensitivity analysis to investigate how a commonly used intermediate-complexity model, the Sacramento Soil Moisture Accounting Model (SAC-SMA), represents a wide range of watersheds with diverse physical and hydroclimatic characteristics. The analysis aims to establish a detailed understanding of model behavior across watersheds and time periods with the ultimate objective to guide model calibration and evaluation studies. Sobol's sensitivity analysis is used to evaluate the SAC-SMA in  Model Parameter Estimation Experiment (MOPEX) watersheds in the US. The watersheds span a wide hydroclimatic gradient from arid to humid systems. Four evaluation metrics reflecting base flows, midrange flows, peak flows, and long-term water balance were used to comprehensively characterize trends in sensitivity and model behavior. Results show significant variation in parameter sensitivities that are correlated with the hydroclimatic characteristics of the watersheds and time periods analyzed. The sensitivity patterns are consistent with the expected dominant processes and demonstrate the need for moderate model complexity to represent different hydroclimatic regimes. The analysis reveals that the primary model controls for some aspects of the simulated hydrograph are different from those typically assumed for the SAC-SMA. Results also show that between  and  parameters are regularly identifiable from daily hydrologic data, which is about twice the range that is often assumed (i. e.,  to ). Synthesized results provide comprehensive SAC-SMA calibration guidance, demonstrate the flexibility of the model for representing multiple hydroclimatic regimes, and highlight the great difficulty in generalizing model behavior across watersheds.",,"van Werkhoven, K|Wagener, T|Reed, P|Tang, Y",WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,,10.1029/2007WR006271

Soil hydraulic functions were estimated in the laboratory on  cm() undisturbed soil cores collected at  locations situated in two horizons in three profile pits along the hillslope. Furthermore, in situ field saturated hydraulic conductivity was estimated at  locations using single-ring pressure infiltrometer measurements.

Due to vitality of continuous supply of drinking water in urban areas, it is necessary to have a performance evaluation and monitoring system to provide the expected level of security in water distribution systems. A main weakness point of these systems is the physical break of pipes which results in high level of water loss, pollution risk and public unsatisfactory. In this study, a framework is developed to increase physical water supply security in urban areas. For this purpose, a physical vulnerability index (PVI) is developed for evaluation of physical statues of water mains. In quantifying PVI, pipe characteristics and bedding soil specifications are considered. The importance of these factors on PVI is determined using Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP). In system performance evaluation, the pipe role in system performance is incorporated regarding pipe location in WDS, distance of pipe from reservoir and average pressure of pipe. Then, System Physical Performance Index (SPVI) is evaluated.

It helps to quantify the relevance of parameters, to estimate their individual contributions to prediction uncertainty, and to better direct further data acquisition. In this work, we propose a response surface method for global sensitivity analysis (based on the arbitrary polynomial chaos expansion, aPC). The key advantages of our proposed technique are: () aPC alleviates the computational burden associated with conventional global sensitivity analysis methods that require many evaluations of a simulation model; () the proposed method incorporates arbitrary independent probability densities or weighting functions for the investigated model parameters, thus generalizing several existing methods to reflect the expected relevance of parameters values within their allowable ranges; and () our framework allows to incorporate this information while requiring only a finite number of statistical moments for the investigated parameters. We generalize the polynomial-based computation of Sobol indices to arbitrary distributions, and suggest an associated complementary new sensitivity measure based on polynomial representation, which allows both univariate and multivariate global analysis. Compared to Sobol indices, our new weighted measure is absolute rather than relative, and converges faster with increasing order of expansion. We use analytical and hybrid analytical-numerical formulations that further improve computational efficiency. Altogether, we can conduct global sensitivity analysis at computational costs that are almost as low as those of local sensitivity analyses.

To reduce the overall computational burden of these simulations, we study the use of reduced order models (ROMs) as numerical surrogates. These ROMs usually involve using solutions to high-fidelity models at different sample points within the parameter space to construct an approximate solution at any point within the parameter space. This paper examines an input-output relational approach based on Gaussian process regression (GPR). We show that these ROMs are more accurate than the linear lookup tables with the same number of high-fidelity simulations.

Here we propose a method, which relies on global sensitivity analysis, to improve local relevance of environmental indicators from global datasets. This method is tested on nitrogen use framework for two contrasted case studies: mixed dairy supply chains in Rwanda and the Netherlands. To achieve this, we evaluate how indicators computed from a global dataset diverge from same indicators computed from survey data. Second, we identify important input parameters that explain the variance of indicators. Subsequently, we fix non-important ones to their average values and substitute important ones with field data. Finally, we evaluate the effect of this substitution. This method improved relevance of nitrogen use indicators; therefore, it can be applied to any environmental modelling using global datasets to improve their relevance by prioritizing important parameters for additional data collection.

Precipitation was measured at a resolution of .mm and aggregated to -, -, -, and -min time steps. Daily discharge data over a -year period were used to calibrate and validate the model. Following a global sensitivity analysis, relevant parameters were optimized through an automatic calibration procedure using SWAT-CUP for each time step. Daily performance statistics were almost equal among all four time steps (NSE approximate to .). Discharge mainly consisted of groundwater flow (%) and tile flow (%), in reasonable proportions for the investigated catchment. In conclusion, model outputs were almost identical, showing simulations responded nearly independently of the chosen precipitation time step. This held true for () the selection of sensitive parameters, () performance statistics, () the shape of the hydrographs, and () flow components. However, a scenario analysis revealed that the precipitation time step becomes important when saturated hydraulic conductivities are low and curve numbers are high.

Hydraulic overloading can occur in a systematic way, for instance when sewer network connections are extended without increasing the WWTP's capacity accordingly. This study demonstrates the use of rule-based real-time control (RTC) to reduce the load to the WWTP while restricting the overall overflow volume of the sewer system to a minimum. Further, it shows the added value of RTC despite the limited availability of monitoring data and information on the catchment through a parsimonious simulation approach, using relocation of spatial system boundaries and creating required input data through reverse modelling. Focus was hereby on the accurate modelling of pump hydraulics and control.

While UNESCO's concerns triggered separate strategic assessments by the Australian and Queensland governments, there has been no independent and integrated review of the key risks within the overall system of governance influencing GBR outcomes. As a case study of international significance, this paper applies Governance Systems Analysis (GSA), a novel analytical framework that identifies the governance themes, domains and subdomains most likely to influence environmental and socioeconomic outcomes in complex natural systems. This GBR-focussed application of GSA identifies governance subdomains that present high, medium, or low risk of failure to produce positive outcomes for the Reef. This enabled us to determine that three ""whole of system"" governance problems could undermine GBR outcomes. First, we stress the integrative importance of the Long Term Sustainability Plan (LISP) Subdomain. Sponsored by the Australian and Queensland governments, this subdomain concerns the primary institutional arrangements for coordinated GBR planning and delivery, but due to its recent emergence, it faces several internal governance challenges. Second, we find a major risk of implementation failure in the achievement of GBR water quality actions due to a lack of system-wide focus on building strong and stable delivery systems at catchment scale. Finally, we conclude that the LTSP Sub domain currently has too limited a mandate capacity to influence several high-risk subdomains that have not been, but must be more strongly aligned with Reef management (e.g. the Greenhouse Gas Emission Management Subdomain). Our analysis enables exploration of governance system reforms needed to address environmental trends in the GBR and reflects on the potential application of GSA in other complex land and sea-scapes across the globe.

This study proves the hypothesis that the OCs have the potential to substantially improve the energy efficiency and plant capacity of established ATAD systems. As ATAD is a semi-batch process, its energy efficiency has to be optimized via dynamic optimization (DO). This methodology requires an adequate mathematical model, and appropriate selection of optimization variables. The paper presents an improved mathematical ATAD model based on previous models found in the literature. A global sensitivity analysis (GSA) was performed in order to identify variables with significant influence upon energy efficiency and plant capacity, thus paving the way for the DO of ATAD systems. The results of the GSA show that reactor volume, reactor temperature, and aeration flowrate are significant variables, which is consistent with reported literature. The results of the GSA also show that both energy efficiency and plant capacity of ATAD systems can be substantially improved by altering reactor volume and OCs. (C) ", Elsevier Ltd.

However, their estimates require an important number of simulations and often cannot be processed under reasonable time constraint. To handle this problem, a Gaussian process regression model is built to approximate the computer code output and the Sobol indices are estimated through it. The aim of this paper is to provide a methodology for estimating the Sobol indices through a surrogate model taking into account both the estimation errors and the surrogate model errors. In particular, it allows us to derive nonasymptotic confidence intervals for the Sobol index estimates.

For selected model variables we evaluate how the sensitivities are influenced by the choice of the rainfall event. The aims are to i) compare both methods concerning the similarity of results and their applicability, ii) discuss the implications for factor fixing (identifying non-influential parameters) and factor prioritisation (identifying important parameters) and iii) rank the important parameters for the investigated model. It was shown that both methods lead to similar results for the hydraulic model. Parameter interactions and non-linearity were identified for the water quality model and the parameter ranking differs between the methods. For the investigated model the results allow a sound choice of output variables and rainfall events in view of detailed uncertainty analysis or model calibration.

In snow-dominated systems, snow, surface and subsurface hydrologic processes comprise a complex network of nonlinear interactions that influence the magnitude and timing of discharge. This study aims to identify critical processes and interactions that control discharge hydrographs in five major mountainous snow-dominated river basins in Colorado, USA. A comprehensive watershed model (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) and a variance-based global sensitivity analysis technique (Fourier Amplitude Sensitivity Test) were used in conjunction to identify critical models parameters and processes that they represent. Average monthly streamflow and streamflow root mean square error over a period of  years were used as two separate objective functions in this analysis. Examination of the sensitivity of monthly streamflow revealed the influence of parameters on flow volume, whereas the sensitivity of streamflow root mean square error also exposed the influence of parameters on the timing of the hydrographs. A stability analysis was performed to investigate the computational requirements for a robust sensitivity analysis. Results show that streamflow volume is mostly influenced by shallow subsurface processes, whereas interactions between groundwater and snow processes were the key in the timing of streamflows.

This study explores the influence of bed clusters and size gradation on OTD for non-uniform bed-loads. First, both static and mobile bed armouring experiments were conducted in laboratorial flumes to monitor the transport of mixed sand/gravel sediments. Only in the mobile armouring experiment did apparent bed clusters develop, because of stable feeding and a longer transport period. Second, a generalized subordinated advection (GSA) model was applied to quantify the observed dynamics of tracer particles. Results show that for the static armour layer (without sediment feed), the best-fit OTD assigns more weight to the large displacement of small particles, likely because of the size-selective entrainment process. The capacity coefficient in the GSA model, which affects the width of the OTD, is space dependent only for small particles whose dynamics can be significantly affected by larger particles and whose distribution is more likely to be space dependent in a mixed sand and gravel system. However, the OTD for the mobile armour layer (with sediment recirculation) exhibited longer tails for larger particles. This is because the trailing edge of larger particles is more resistant to erosion, and their leading front may not be easily trapped by self-organized bed clusters. The strong interaction between particle-bed may cause the capacity coefficient to be space-dependent for bed-load transport along mobile armour layers. Therefore, the combined laboratory experiments and stochastic model analysis show that the OTD may be affected more by particle-bed interactions (such as clusters) than by particle-particle interactions (e.g. hiding and exposing), and that the GSA model can quantify mixed-size sand/gravel transport along river beds within either static or mobile armour layers."," Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Zhang, Y|Chen, D|Garrard, R|Sun, HG|Lu, YH",HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,operational time distribution bed-load transport clusters static bed armouring mobile bed armouring,10.1002/hyp.10837

Counter to this purpose, diagnostic analyses of distributed models currently aggregate performance measures in space and/or time and are thus disconnected from the models' operational and scientific goals. To address this disconnect, this study contributes a novel approach for computing and visualizing time-varying global sensitivity indices for spatially distributed model parameters. The high-resolution model diagnostics employ the method of Morris to identify evolving patterns in dominant model processes at sub-daily timescales over a six-month period. The method is demonstrated on the United States National Weather Service's Hydrology Laboratory Research Distributed Hydrologic Model (HL-RDHM) in the Blue River watershed, Oklahoma, USA. Three hydrologic events are selected from within the six-month period to investigate the patterns in spatiotemporal sensitivities that emerge as a function of forcing patterns as well as wet-to-dry transitions. Events with similar magnitudes and durations exhibit significantly different performance controls in space and time, indicating that the diagnostic inferences drawn from representative events will be heavily biased by the a priori selection of those events. By contrast, this study demonstrates high-resolution time-varying sensitivity analysis, requiring no assumptions regarding representative events and allowing modelers to identify transitions between sets of dominant parameters or processes a posteriori. The proposed approach details the dynamics of parameter sensitivity in nearly continuous time, providing critical diagnostic insights into the underlying model processes driving predictions. Furthermore, the approach offers the potential to identify transition points between dominant parameters and processes in the absence of observations, such as under nonstationarity.",,"Herman, JD|Kollat, JB|Reed, PM|Wagener, T",HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES,,10.5194/hess-17-5109-2013

To address this gap, we investigated the ability of a physically based watershed model (the Distributed Hydrology-Soil-Vegetation Model) to represent controls on metrics of hydrologic partitioning across five adjacent headwater subcatchments. The five study subcatchments, located in Tenderfoot Creek Experimental Forest in central Montana, have similar climate but variable topography and vegetation distribution. This facilitated a comparative hydrology approach to interpret how parameters that influence partitioning, detected via global sensitivity analysis, differ across catchments. Model parameters were constrained a priori using existing regional information and expert knowledge. Influential parameters were compared to perceptions of catchment functioning and its variability across subcatchments. Despite between-catchment differences in topography and vegetation, hydrologic partitioning across all metrics and all subcatchments was sensitive to a similar subset of snow, vegetation, and soil parameters. Results also highlighted one subcatchment with low certainty in parameter sensitivity, indicating that the model poorly represented some complexities in this subcatchment likely because an important process is missing or poorly characterized in the mechanistic model. For use in other basins, this method can assess parameter sensitivities as a function of the specific ungauged system to which it is applied.

It remains contested whether this mechanism is effective and many authors have raised equity concerns regarding its impact on water users. For example, speculative hoarding of water rights in expectations of their increasing value has been described. This paper demonstrates how farmers can hoard water rights as a risk management strategy for variable water supply, for example, due to the cycles of El Nino or as consequence of climate change. While farmers with insufficient water rights can rely on unclaimed water during conditions of normal water availability, drought years overproportionally impact on their supply of irrigation water and thereby farm profitability.

Design/methodology/approach - The probabilistic uncertainties in the iron losses are modelled with the spectral approach using chaos polynomials. The Sobol indices are used for the global sensitivity analysis. The machine is modelled with a D finite element method and the iron losses are computed with a previously developed accurate method. Findings - The uncertainties propagate in different ways to the different components of losses, i.e. eddy current, hysteresis, and excess losses. The propagation is also different depending on the investigated region of the machine, i.e. Stator or rotor teeth, yokes, tooth tips. Research limitations/implications - The method does not account for uncertainties related to the manufacturing process, which might result in even larger variability. Practical implications - A major implication of the findings is that the identification of iron loss parameters at low frequencies does not affect the loss variability. The identification with high-frequency measurement is very important for the rotor tooth tips. The variability in the excess loss parameters is of low impact. Originality/value - The presented results are of importance for the magnetic material manufacturers and the electrical machine designers. The manufacturers can plan the measurement and identification procedures as to minimize the output variability of the parameters. The designers of the machine can use the result and the presented procedures to estimate the variability of their design.",,"Belahcen, A|Rasilo, P|Nguyen, TT|Clenet, S",COMPEL-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR COMPUTATION AND MATHEMATICS IN ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONIC ENGINEERING,electrical machine finite element methods uncertainty estimation iron losses,10.1108/COMPEL-10-2014-0271

This creates computational difficulties for the uncertainty propagation (UP) analysis of these models due the need for repeated numerical simulations in order to adequately capture the underlying statistics that describe the uncertainty in model outputs. Moreover, despite the obvious advantages of moment-independent global sensitivity analysis (SA) methods, these methods have rarely been employed for SWI and other complex groundwater models. The reason is that moment-independent global SA methods involve repeated UP analysis which further becomes computationally demanding. This study proposes the use of non-intrusive polynomial chaos expansions (PCEs) as a means to significantly accelerate UP analysis in SWI numerical modeling studies and shows that despite the highly non-linear and non-smooth input/output relationship that exists in SWI models, non-intrusive PCEs provide a reliable and yet computationally efficient surrogate of the original numerical model. The study illustrates that for the considered two and six dimensional UP problems, PCEs offer a more accurate estimation of the statistics describing the uncertainty in model outputs compared to Monte Carlo simulations based on the original numerical model. This study also shows that the use of non-intrusive PCEs in the estimation of the moment-independent sensitivity indices (i.e. delta indices) decreases the computational time by several orders of magnitude without causing significant loss of accuracy. The use of non-intrusive PCEs for the generation of SWI hazard maps is proposed to extend the practical applications of UP analysis in coastal aquifer management studies.", (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The model considers various geologic settings, includes sorption and degradation processes and is tested by comparison with data from a tracer experiment where fluorescein dye injected in a river is monitored at nearby drinking water wells. Three compounds were considered: an older pesticide MCPP (Mecoprop) which is mobile and relatively persistent, glyphosate (Roundup), a newer biodegradable and strongly sorbing pesticide, and its degradation product AMPA. Global sensitivity analysis using the Morris method is employed to identify the dominant model parameters. Results show that the characteristics of clay aquitards (degree of fracturing and thickness), pollutant properties and well depths are crucial factors when evaluating the risk of drinking water well contamination from surface water. This study suggests that it is unlikely that glyphosate in streams can pose a threat to drinking water wells, while MCPP in surface water can represent a risk: MCPP concentration at the drinking water well can be up to % of surface water concentration in confined aquifers and up to % in unconfined aquifers. Thus, the presence of confining clay aquitards may not prevent contamination of drinking water wells by persistent compounds in surface water.

In a complementary approach comprehensive models of the root system architecture are being developed, but the parameters required for these models are often difficult to assess in field conditions. In this paper, we bridge both approaches, empirical and comprehensive, by evaluating the capability of architectural models to simulate the observed diversity in root length distribution on the one hand and the possibility of estimating developmental parameters from root length density profiles on the other. For this purpose, we constructed a simple model with only six parameters, to represent the root system architecture. It reproduced a large diversity of root profiles comparable to observations reported in the literature and encompassing many different crops. The impact of each model parameter, as well as their interactions, on the shape of the profiles was quantified using a global sensitivity analysis. Finally, a statistical meta-model was designed and estimated to simulate the same collection of profiles without intermediate simulating the whole architecture. The meta-model allows for estimation of architectural parameters from profile shapes (inversion). Some architectural parameters could be estimated from the profiles with good accuracy, especially those quantifying the growth potential and gravitropism of individual roots, because of their specific impact on root length at a specific depth. But others (like inter-branch distance, life duration), which modify root density in a more diffuse way throughout the profile, could not be identified correctly using this method.

The application considers the spatially-distributed agro-hydrological model TNT, and its sensitivity to soil characteristics and their spatial distribution (soil pattern). The final goal is to identify soil input data that require more accurate description (measurement) and the relevant spatial resolution for soil information. Based on methods commonly used for non-spatially-distributed models (Morris method and a fractional factorial design with ANOVA), the proposed approach is innovative in the way that spatial input factors are considered in the global sensitivity analysis. The global sensitivity analysis is performed in three steps (i) screening among soil input data to identify those that most affect model outputs, (ii) quantifying the sensitivity of TNT to the dominant soil input factors and their interactions when considering a single soil and (iii) incorporating the soil pattern into the global sensitivity as an explicit input factor. The results indicate differences in the hierarchy of influential input factors between the screening and quantitative methods. The model's low sensitivity to spatial patterns provides recommendations for further field sampling campaigns. The hierarchical approach developed in this paper is based on sensitivity analysis methods with relatively low computational demand.

Effective planning and management of limited WEF resources to meet current and future socioeconomic demands for sustainable development is challenging. WEF production/delivery may also produce environmental impacts; as a result, green-house-gas emission control will impact WEF nexus management as well. Nexus management for WEF security necessitates integrated tools for predictive analysis that are capable of identifying the tradeoffs among various sectors, generating cost-effective planning and management strategies and policies. To address these needs, we have developed an integrated model analysis framework and tool called WEFO. WEFO provides a multi-period socioeconomic model for predicting how to satisfy WEF demands based on model inputs representing productions costs, socioeconomic demands, and environmental controls. WEFO is applied to quantitatively analyze the interrelationships and trade-offs among system components including energy supply, electricity generation, water supply-demand, food production as well as mitigation of environmental impacts. WEFO is demonstrated to solve a hypothetical nexus management problem consistent with real-world management scenarios.

This study documents how the potential removal of organic MP in stormwater treatment systems can be quantified by using multimedia models. The fate of four different MP in a stormwater retention pond was simulated by applying two steady-state multimedia fate models (EPI Suite and SimpleBox) commonly applied in chemical risk assessment and a dynamic multimedia fate model (Stormwater Treatment Unit Model for Micro Pollutants - STUMP). The four simulated organic stormwater MP (iodopropynyl butylcarbamate - IPBC, benzene, glyphosate and pyrene) were selected according to their different urban sources and environmental fate. This ensures that the results can be extended to other relevant stormwater pollutants. All three models use substance inherent properties to calculate MP fate but differ in their ability to represent the small physical scale and high temporal variability of stormwater treatment systems. Therefore the three models generate different results. A Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA) highlighted that settling/resuspension of particulate matter was the most sensitive process for the dynamic model. The uncertainty of the estimated MP fluxes can be reduced by calibrating the dynamic model against total suspended solids data. This reduction in uncertainty was more significant for the substances with strong tendency to sorb, i.e. glyphosate and pyrene and less significant for substances with a smaller tendency to sorb, i.e. IPBC and benzene.

We investigate how this predictive uncertainty is affected by uncertainty in both the location of the region occupied by a dose-enhancing iodinated contrast agent and the agent's concentration. This is done within the probabilistic framework in which these uncertain parameters are modeled as random variables. We employ the stochastic collocation (SC) method to estimate statistical moments of the deposited energy in terms of statistical moments of the random inputs, and the global sensitivity analysis (GSA) to quantify the relative importance of uncertainty in these parameters on the overall predictive uncertainty. A nonlinear radiation-diffusion equation dramatically magnifies the coefficient of variation of the uncertain parameters, yielding a large coefficient of variation for the predicted energy deposition. This demonstrates that accurate prediction of the energy deposition requires a proper treatment of even small parametric uncertainty.

Empirical orthogonal functions (EOF) are used to formulate both spatial perturbations to initial conditions and space-time wind forcing perturbations, namely in the form of a superposition of modal components with uniformly distributed random amplitudes.

These PC surrogate models are constructed using basis pursuit denoising methodology, and their performance is assessed through various statistical measures. A global sensitivity analysis is then performed to quantify the impact of individual modes as well as their interactions. It shows that the local SSH at the edge of the GoM main current-the Loop Current-is mostly sensitive to perturbations of the initial conditions affecting the current front, whereas the local MLD in the area of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill is more sensitive to wind forcing perturbations. At the basin scale, the SSH in the deep GoM is mostly sensitive to initial condition perturbations, while over the shelf it is sensitive to wind forcing perturbations. On the other hand, the basin MLD is almost exclusively sensitive to wind perturbations. For both quantities, the two sources of uncertainty have limited interactions.

Hence, there is limited understanding of how forcing error characteristics affect simulations of cold region hydrology and which error characteristics are most important. Here we employ global sensitivity analysis to explore how () different error types (i.e., bias, random errors), () different error probability distributions, and () different error magnitudes influence physically based simulations of four snow variables (snow water equivalent, ablation rates, snow disappearance, and sublimation). We use the Sobol' global sensitivity analysis, which is typically used for model parameters but adapted here for testing model sensitivity to coexisting errors in all forcings. We quantify the Utah Energy Balance model's sensitivity to forcing errors with    Monte Carlo simulations across four sites and five different scenarios. Model outputs were () consistently more sensitive to forcing biases than random errors, () generally less sensitive to forcing error distributions, and () critically sensitive to different forcings depending on the relative magnitude of errors. For typical error magnitudes found in areas with drifting snow, precipitation bias was the most important factor for snow water equivalent, ablation rates, and snow disappearance timing, but other forcings had a more dominant impact when precipitation uncertainty was due solely to gauge undercatch.

In particular, the Standardised Regression Coefficients, Morris Screening and Extended-FAST methods are applied to a complex integrated membrane bioreactor (MBR) model considering  model outputs and  model factors. The three methods are applied with numerical settings as suggested in literature. The main objective considered is to classify important factors (factors prioritisation) as well as non-influential factors (factors fixing). The performance is assessed by comparing the most reliable method (Extended-FAST), by means of proposed criteria, with the two other methods. In particular, similarity to results obtained from Extended-FAST is assessed for sensitivity indices, for the ranking of sensitivity indices, for the classification into important/non-influential factors and for the method's ability to detect interaction among factors and to provide results in a reasonable time. It was found that the computationally less expensive SRC method was applied outside its range of applicability (R-) = (.-.) < .. Still, the SRC produced a ranking of important factors similar to Extended-FAST. For some variables significant interactions among the factors were revealed by computing the total effect indices S-Ti using Extended-FAST. This means that to obtain reliable variance decomposition and to detect and quantify interactions among the factors, the use of the Extended-FAST is recommended. Regarding the comparison between Morris screening and Extended-FAST a poor agreement was found. In particular, the Morris screening overestimated the number of both important and non-influential factors compared to Extended-FAST for the analysed case study. (C) ", Elsevier Ltd.

Use of these synergistic techniques aims to improve the estimates of key parameters characterising land surface interactions by combining the horizontal coverage and spectral resolution of remote sensing data with the vertical coverage and fine temporal continuity of simulation process models. This study performs a Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA) on the SimSphere land surface model aiming to further extend our understanding of the model structure and establish its coherence. It builds on previous works conducted on the model to which a sophisticated and cutting edge GSA meta-modelling method adopting Bayesian theory is implemented. Our first objective is to examine the effect of assuming uniform probability distribution function (PDFs) for the model inputs/outputs on the sensitivity of key quantities simulated by SimSphere. A further objective is to explore the sensitivity of new, previously unexplored variables simulated by the model, namely of the Daily Evaporative, Non-Evaporative Fractions and Radiometric Temperature. The GSA conducted assuming uniform PDFs showed comparable results to previous studies in terms of identifying the most sensitive model inputs to each of the outputs considered. Yet, in absolute terms, the statistical parameters measuring the sensitivity of the model inputs were notably different. SA on the newly examined model outputs showed largely explainable results and allowed identification of the most responsive model inputs and interactions. In general, our results provided further evidence supporting the model coherence and correspondence to the behaviour of a natural system. The implications of the main findings are discussed in the framework of the model use either as a stand-alone tool or synergistically with EO data, particularly so towards the operational development of such products.

Proper tools are nowadays applied in order to gain in-sight into soil moisture status, especially of uppermost soil layers, which are prone to weather changes and land use practices. In order to establish relationships between meteorological conditions and topsoil moisture, a simple model would be required, characterized by low computational effort, simple structure and low number of identified and calibrated parameters. We demonstrated, that existing model for shallow soils, considering mass exchange between two layers (the upper and the lower), as well as with the atmosphere and subsoil, worked well for sandy loam with deep ground water table in Warsaw conurbation.

Fixed nets are a matter of concern for sea turtles mainly in coastal areas during the neritic stage when both juvenile and adult life stages are affected. Mortality caused by entanglement in set nets is related to forced apnoea due to the high soak time of the nets and consequent drowning. This study investigated the loggerhead turtle bycatch in set net coastal fisheries in the northern Adriatic Sea (General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean Geographical Sub-Area , [GSA ]) through an interview-based approach, to understand the potential contribution of these fisheries to the general decline of the sea turtle population. A second goal was to identify a possible hot-spot turtle bycatch area through on-board observations. The study estimates that more than  turtles are caught in the west GSA  each year with the largest number in the summer. A hot-spot for entanglement was also identified in an area located south of the River Po delta (.-m depth) during the summer. Sixty-four turtles were caught over a period of  fishing days by either trammel nets and gillnets (. and . turtle per km of net respectively) and was the greatest number that has been observed anywhere in the Mediterranean.

The analysis is used to investigate the important features of the oxidation process, as well as possible factors underlying qualitative discrepancies between simulations and experiments. The particular feature of interest is the characteristic of quadratic autocatalysis, which is observed experimentally and leads to the maximum rate of reaction occurring at % consumption of the deficient reactant (oxygen), with the fuel consumption exerting only a weak dependence. The kinetic mechanisms tested do not exhibit this characteristic when simulating the experimental conditions. The models also exhibit shorter induction times than those observed in the experiment. The HDMR study demonstrates a sensitivity of these features to the A-factors of key reactions of the cyclohexylperoxy radical (CHOO). At the low temperatures studied here, these are peroxy-peroxy radical reactions rather than the isomerisation routes that have been the subject of other investigations at higher temperatures. The low temperature product channels for reactions of the cyclohexylperoxy radical are therefore an important area for future kinetic studies. The effects of wall reactions of peroxy and peroxide species were not found to outweigh the impact of the main A-factors, but including wall losses led to significant higher order interactions between input parameters.

The two most common variance-based sensitivity measures, the first-order effects and the total effects, may fail to sum to the total variance. They are often used together in sensitivity analysis, because neither of them adequately deals with interactions in the way the inputs affect the output. Therefore Owen proposed an alternative sensitivity measure, based on the concept of the Shapley value in game theory, and showed it always sums to the correct total variance if inputs are independent. We analyze Owen's measure, which we call the Shapley effect, in the case of dependent inputs. We show empirically how the first-order and total effects, even when used together, may fail to appropriately measure how sensitive the output is to uncertainty in the inputs when there is probabilistic dependence or structural interaction among the inputs. Because they involve all subsets of the inputs, Shapley effects could be expensive to compute if the number of inputs is large. We propose a Monte Carlo algorithm that makes accurate approximation of Shapley effects computationally affordable, and we discuss efficient allocation of the computation budget in this algorithm.",,"Song, EH|Nelson, BL|Staum, J",SIAM-ASA JOURNAL ON UNCERTAINTY QUANTIFICATION,shapley value computer experiments global sensitivity,10.1137/15M1048070

These models require as input many soil-texture and land-use-related parameters. Difficulties encountered in determining the values of these input parameters warrant an investigation on their relative importance. In this study, a series of global sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate the response of selected outputs from a continuous-simulation soil moisture model to variations of specified input parameters. Using randomly generated input parameter values representing various site conditions, the soil moisture model was run with meteorological data from Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Three output statistics, namely, average soil moisture, the standard deviation, and skewness of the output daily soil moisture distributions, were determined from each model run. Four types of sensitivity indices between the output statistics and the input parameters were calculated. Based on these sensitivity indices, it was concluded that the wilting and hygroscopic-point soil moisture levels and the soil moisture level below which plants start to endure water stress are the most important input parameters for all three output statistics. The relative importance of soil's porosity, saturated conductivity, and the runoff curve number of the study area becomes greater and almost reaches the same level as the most important parameters when the skewness of the output daily soil moisture distributions is the output statistic of interest.

The considered constitutive model is Huber-Mises deviatoric plasticity with non-linear isotropic/kinematic hardening, one which is applicable to metals. The standard radial return algorithm for linear hardening is generalized to account for non-linear hardening functions. Two generalizations are presented; in both the non-linearity is treated iteratively, but the iteration loop contains either a scalar equation or a group of tensorial equations. It is proven that the second formulation, which is the one used in some parallel codes, can be equivalently brought to a scalar form, more suitable for design differentiation. The design derivatives of both the algorithms are given explicitly, enabling thus calculation of the 'explicit' design derivative of stresses entering the global sensitivity equation. The paper addresses several issues related to the implementation and testing of the DSA module; among them the concept of verification tests, both outside and inside a FE code, as well as the data handling implied by the algorithm. The numerical tests, which are used for verification of the DSA module, are described. They shed light on (a) the accuracy of the design derivatives, by comparison with finite difference computations and (b) the effect of the finite element formulation on the design derivatives for an isochoric plastic flow."," Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.","Wisniewski, K|Kowalczyk, P|Turska, E",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUMERICAL METHODS IN ENGINEERING,design sensitivity analysis elasto-plastic material with non-linear hardening parallel finite element code,10.1002/nme.678

Recent years have seen a rapid uptake in the adoption of the German Passivhaus standard as a template for ultra-low energy and zero carbon buildings in the UK. Despite genuine motivations to mitigate climate change and fuel poverty there is a lack of research investigating the long-term performance of Passivhaus buildings in a rapidly changing UK climate. This paper sets out to investigate whether Passivhaus dwellings will be able to provide high standards of thermal comfort in the future or whether they are inherently vulnerable to overheating risks. Scenario modelling using probabilistic data derived from the UKCP weather generator (WG) in conjunction with dynamic simulation and global sensitivity analysis techniques are used to assess the future performance of a range of typical Passivhaus dwellings relative to an identical Fabric Energy Efficiency Standard (FEES) compliant dwelling over its notional future lifespan. The emphasis of this study is to understand what impact climate change will pose to overheating risks for Passivhaus dwellings relative to the de facto (i.e. FEES) alternative, and which design factors play a dominant role in contributing to this risk. The results show that optimization of a small number of design inputs, including glazing ratios and external shading devices, can play a significant role in mitigating future overheating risks.

Moreover, an understanding of the representation, sensitivity and coherence of such models are vital for the operationalisation of any physically based model. A Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA) was conducted on the SimSphere land biosphere model in which a meta-modelling method adopting Bayesian theory was implemented. Initially, effects of assuming uniform probability distribution functions (PDFs) for the model inputs, when examining sensitivity of key quantities simulated by SimSphere at different output times, were examined. The development of topographic model input parameters (e.g., slope, aspect, and elevation) were derived within a Geographic Information System (GIS) before implementation within the model. The effect of time of the simulation on the sensitivity of previously examined outputs was also analysed. Results showed that simulated outputs were significantly influenced by changes in topographic input parameters, fractional vegetation cover, vegetation height and surface moisture availability in agreement with previous studies. Time of model output simulation had a significant influence on the absolute values of the output variance decomposition, but it did not seem to change the relative importance of each input parameter. Sensitivity Analysis (SA) results of the newly modelled outputs allowed identification of the most responsive model inputs and interactions.

Given the uncertainty of problem parameters, the risk of contamination of the vegetation capture zone needs to be cast in a probabilistic framework. In order to exemplify real situations existing along the Adriatic coast of Emilia-Romagna, a case study involving a pinewood strip and a well field drawing freshwater from an unconfined coastal aquifer was examined. On the basis of a widely adopted sharp interface formulation, key hydrogeological problem parameters were modeled as random variables, and a global sensitivity analysis was carried out to determine their influence on the position of the interface.

This is especially problematic in data-poor areas where values for model inputs are lacking or measured on temporally and/or spatially sparse scales. The objective of this work is to conduct a global sensitivity and uncertainty analysis (GSA/UA) of the Pitman semidistributed hydrologic model for the data-poor Okavango Basin in southern Africa under both stationary and climate change scenarios. The Morris GSA method allowed qualitative ranking of important model inputs whereas the variance-based Fourier amplitude sensitivity test (FAST) method quantitatively identified the parametric uncertainty and sensitivity to these inputs. Results showed that the most important model inputs determining mean annual flow and model fit to observed data were the infiltration rate and the temporal rainfall distribution. In addition, the wetter western headwaters region was shown to be the most important region in determining the flow at the outlet of the basin. Parameter equifinality was significant in this study, and hence the evaluation of the relationships between mechanisms was not straightforward. Analysis of model results under climate change scenarios showed that a hot and wet scenario introduced more change in mean annual flow than a hot and dry scenario. The climate change scenarios also altered model sensitivity. For example, the parameter that controls the rate of infiltration decreased in importance and the parameter that controls soil moisture storage gained importance under the dry scenario.

The atomic energies obtained with the new basis sets are substantially better than the ones obtained with the standard ones. The new basis sets were tested for several diatomic and triatomic molecules, at different levels of calculation. For the molecules at their geometries of equilibrium, the energies obtained with the GSA optimized basis are in general much better than the respective ones obtained with the standard basis. However, for molecules containing hydrogen atoms, the best results, either at the HF or CI level of calculation, are obtained with a combination of the new and the standard bases, which depend on the nature of the other atoms of the molecule.

Subsequent measurements for unfiltered air showed minimal charged particle mobility influence. Progeny particle size measurements reported here, performed at the US Department of Energy Environmental Measurement Laboratory (now with Home Security Department), using the EML graded screen array (GSA) system show in unfiltered air that the high Rn- levels causes a reduction in the attached Po- progeny airborne particulates and formation of additional normal sized unattached (similar to. nm) and also even smaller Po- below . nm. At a Rn- level of  kBq m(-), % of all Po- are of a mean particle diameter of about .+/-. nm. At this Rn- level, the ratio of Po- to Rn- airborne concentrations is reduced significantly from the concentration ratio at low Rn- levels. Similar reductions and size reformations were observed for the Pb- and Bi-/Po progeny. The particle size changes are further confirmed using the plateout rates and corresponding deposition velocities. The Crump and Seinfeld deposition theory provides the corresponding particle diffusion coefficients. With the diffusion coefficient to ultrafine clustered particle diameter correlation of Ramamurthi and Hopke, good agreement is obtained between EML GSA and deposition velocity data down to . nm. Strong evidence is presented that the progeny size reduction is due to, as a result of air ionization, the increased neutralization rate (primarily from electron scavenging of OH molecules) of the initially charged progeny. This is shown to increase with the / power of Rn- concentration and relative humidity as well as increased air change rate in the chamber. These results imply that at Rn- levels above  kBq m(-), at relative humidity of %, a considerable reduction in lung dose could occur from preferential deposition of the progeny in the nasal and oral passages.",,"Leonard, BE",RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY,,10.1093/rpd/nch042

The large amount of design parameters including size, shape of cross-sections and positions of various parts are the main contributors to the challenge, which will lead to the huge computational cost for running a large number of finite element (FE) simulations and function evaluations. To handle this problem, an efficient lightweight design strategy which integrates implicit parameterization technique, global sensitivity analysis (GSA) and Pareto set pursuing (PSP) algorithm is proposed in this paper to explore the lightweight design of BIW. Firstly, a full parameterized model of BIW is established with implicit parametrization technique via SFE-CONCEPT. Secondly, the GSA technique is used to reduce the dimensions of design space. Finally, the parameterized model of BIW is optimized by PSP method directly in the reduced design space.

In order to better understand how these complex models work, efficient screening methods are required in order to identify the most important parameters. This is of particular importance for models that are used within an operational real-time forecasting chain such as HQsim. The objectives of this investigation are to (i) identify the most sensitive parameters of the complex HQsim model applied in the Alpine Lech catchment and (ii) compare model parameter sensitivity rankings attained from three global sensitivity analysis techniques. The techniques presented are the (i) regional sensitivity analysis, (ii) Morris analysis and (iii) state-dependent parameter modelling. The results indicate that parameters affecting snow melt as well as processes in the unsaturated soil zone reveal high significance in the analysed catchment. The snow melt parameters show clear temporal patterns in the sensitivity whereas most of the parameters affecting processes in the unsaturated soil zone do not vary in importance across the year. Overall, the maximum degree day factor (meltfunc_max) has been identified to play a key role within the HQsim model. Although the parameter sensitivity rankings are equivalent between methods for a number of parameters, for several key parameters differing results were obtained.

This study investigates the potentiality of brown sand aquifers (BSA) as a safe drinking water source by characterizing its hydrogeochemical contrast to grey sand aquifers (GSA) within shallow depth (< m) over an area of  km() in Chakdaha Block of Nadia district, West Bengal, India. The results indicate that despite close similarity in major ion composition, the redox condition is markedly different in groundwater of the two studied aquifers. The redox condition in the BSA is delineated to be Mn oxy-hydroxide reducing, not sufficiently lowered for As mobilization into groundwater. In contrast, the enrichments of NH+, PO-, Fe and As along with lower Eh in groundwater of GSA reflect reductive dis-solution of Fe oxy-hydroxide coupled to microbially mediated oxidation of organic matter as the prevailing redox process causing As mobilization into groundwater of this aquifer type. In some portions of GSA the redox status even has reached to the stage of SO- reduction, which to some extent might sequester dissolved As from groundwater by co-precipitation with authigenic pyrite. Despite having low concentration of As in groundwater of the BSA the concentration of Mn often exceeds the drinking water guidelines, which warrants rigorous assessment of attendant health risk for Mn prior to considering mass scale exploitation of the BSA for possible sustainable drinking water supply.", (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Traditional one-dimensional (D) plane-parallel atmospheric radiative transfer models which use the independent pixel approximation (IPA) can only consider two extreme conditions, i.e., either cloud-free or overcast cases. In this paper, two cloud fraction related factors (hemispherical effective cloud fraction and regional cloud fraction) are calculated and incorporated into MODTRAN  (one of the most popular radiative transfer packages) to simulate the surface shortwave radiation components and the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiance for all possible solar-cloud-viewing geometries. The accuracy of this modified solar radiative transfer model (named as MODTRAN-CF) is consistent with its prototype (MODTRAN ) which has been widely used and validated in radiative transfer modeling. Some field measurements are used to validate the superiority of MODTRAN-CF. For further understanding and simplifying of this physical model, a global sensitivity analysis (GSA) method is employed to analyze the effect of model parameters on each surface shortwave radiation component. Five parameters including solar zenith angle, surface albedo, hemispherical effective cloud fraction, ground altitude and atmospheric visibility show non-negligible impacts on almost all surface shortwave fluxes, which indicates that these five parameters should be carefully considered in the future modeling of the surface shortwave radiation fluxes. Two cloud optical thickness related parameters (cloud extinction coefficient and cloud thickness) exhibit obvious importance only under cloudy illumination condition especially with optically thin clouds.

Good agreement is achieved between the simulated evapotranspiration, soil moisture and crop production and their respective field measurements made under current maize irrigation and fertilization. Based on the calibrated model, the scenario analysis reveals that the most optimal amount of irrigation is -mm in this region. However, for regions without detailed observation, the results of the numerical simulation can be unreliable for irrigation decision making owing to the shortage of calibrated model boundary conditions and parameters. So, we develop a method of combining model ensemble simulations and uncertainty/sensitivity analysis to speculate the probability of crop production. In our studies, the uncertainty analysis is used to reveal the risk of facing a loss of crop production as irrigation decreases.

However, standard global sensitivity analysis aims at measuring the contribution of input variables to model output uncertainty on average by investigating their full distribution ranges, but does not investigate the contribution of specific ranges. To deal with this problem, researchers have developed several regional sensitivity analysis techniques such as the contribution to sample mean and variance (CSM and CSV) plots. In this paper, a moment-independent regional sensitivity analysis technique called contribution to delta indices (CDI) plot is developed for assessing the effect of a specific range of an individual input to the uncertainty of model output. The CDI plot can be obtained with the same set of samples used for computing the CSM and CSV. Compared with the CSM and CSV, the CDI plot uses the probability density function shift of model output to describe the uncertainty instead of the mean and variance, thus it is moment-independent.

Least squares regression methods explicitly assume Gaussian residuals, and the assumption leads to Gaussian likelihood functions, model parameters, and model predictions. While the Bayesian methods do not explicitly require the Gaussian assumption, Gaussian residuals are widely used. This paper shows that the residuals of the reactive transport model are non-Gaussian, heteroscedastic, and correlated in time; characterizing them requires using a generalized likelihood function such as the formal generalized likelihood function developed by Schoups and Vrugt (). For the surface complexation model considered in this study for simulating uranium reactive transport in groundwater, parametric uncertainty is quantified using the least squares regression methods and Bayesian methods with both Gaussian and formal generalized likelihood functions. While the least squares methods and Bayesian methods with Gaussian likelihood function produce similar Gaussian parameter distributions, the parameter distributions of Bayesian uncertainty quantification using the formal generalized likelihood function are non-Gaussian. In addition, predictive performance of formal generalized likelihood function is superior to that of least squares regression and Bayesian methods with Gaussian likelihood function. The Bayesian uncertainty quantification is conducted using the differential evolution adaptive metropolis (DREAM((ZS))) algorithm; as a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method, it is a robust tool for quantifying uncertainty in groundwater reactive transport models. For the surface complexation model, the regression-based local sensitivity analysis and Morris-and DREAM((ZS))-based global sensitivity analysis yield almost identical ranking of parameter importance.

We argue that appropriate model calibration procedures can access additional sources of information, compensating the lack of direct parameter estimates. Our objective is to show how model calibration using population-level data can facilitate the construction of SEPMs that produce reliable predictions for conservation even when direct parameter estimates are inadequate. We constructed a spatially explicit and individual-based population model for the dynamics of brown bears (Ursus arctos) after a reintroduction program in Austria. To calibrate the model we developed a procedure that compared the simulated population dynamics with distinct features of the known population dynamics (= patterns). This procedure detected model parameterizations that did not reproduce the known dynamics. Global sensitivity analysis of the uncalibrated model revealed high uncertainty in most model predictions due to large parameter uncertainties (coefficients of variation CV approximate to .). However, the calibrated model yielded predictions with considerably reduced uncertainty (CV approximate to .). A pattern or a combination of various patterns that embed information on the entire model dynamics can reduce the uncertainty in model predictions, and the application of different patterns with high information content yields the same model predictions. In contrast, a pattern that does not embed information on the entire population dynamics (e.g., bear observations taken from sub-areas of the study area) does not reduce uncertainty in model predictions.

This study reported a comprehensive global sensitivity analysis for DRAINMOD-FOREST, an integrated model for simulating water, carbon (C), and nitrogen (N) cycles and plant growth in lowland forests. The analysis was carried out for multiple long-term model predictions of hydrology, biogeochemistry, and plant growth. Results showed that long-term mean hydrological predictions were highly sensitive to several key plant physiological parameters. Long-term mean annual soil organic C content and mineralization rate were mainly controlled by temperature-related parameters for soil organic matter decomposition. Mean annual forest productivity and N uptake were found to be mainly dependent upon plant production-related parameters, including canopy quantum use efficiency and carbon use efficiency. Mean annual nitrate loss was highly sensitive to parameters controlling both hydrology and plant production, while mean annual dissolved organic nitrogen loss was controlled by parameters associated with its production and physical sorption. Parameters controlling forest production, C allocation, and specific leaf area highly affected long-term mean annual leaf area. Results of this study could help minimize the efforts needed for calibrating DRAINMOD-FOREST.

In this study, replicate columns with aged woodchips were subjected to a range of measured flow rates and influent nitrate concentrations with an artificial stormwater matrix. Dissolved oxygen (DO), nitrate, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) were measured along the length of the columns. A multispecies reactive transport model with Michaelis-Menten kinetics was developed to explain the concentration profiles of DO, nitrate, and DOC. Four additional models were developed based on simplifying assumptions, and all five models were tested for their ability to predict nitrate concentrations in the experimental columns. Global sensitivity analysis and constrained optimization determined the set of parameters that minimized the root-mean-squared error (RMSE) between the model and the experimental data. A k-fold validation test revealed no statistical difference in RMSE for predicting nitrate concentrations between a zero-order model and the other multispecies reactive transport models tested. Additionally, the multispecies reactive transport models demonstrated no significant differences in predicting DO and DOC concentrations. These results suggest that denitrification in an aged woodchip bioreactor at constant temperature can effectively be modeled using zero-order kinetics when nitrate concentrations are > mg-N L-.

The objective and quantitative calculation of the importance of sustainable assessment indicators is a key problem in the accurate evaluation of SD. Traditional methods fail to quantify the coupling effects among indicators. This paper presents a weight determination approach based on the global sensitivity analysis algorithm known as the extended Fourier amplitude sensitivity test (EFAST). This method is efficient and robust and is not only able to quantify the sensitivity of the evaluation indictors to the target, but can also quantitatively describe the uncertainties among the indictors. In this paper, we analyze the sensitivity of  indicators in a multi-index comprehensive evaluation model and weigh the indicators in the system according to their importance. To verify the feasibility and advantages of this new method, we compare the evaluation result with the traditional entropy method. The comparison shows that the EFAST algorithm can provide greater detail in an SD evaluation.

The river completely freezes over during winter; hence, the sensitivity analysis was carried out seasonally, for winter and summer, to account for the influence of ice-covered conditions on nutrient transformations. Furthermore, the integrity of the river's aquatic ecosystem was examined through the inter-relationship between variables and comparing hierarchy index values and water quality indices at four locations along the river. Sensitivities of model parameters varied slightly at different locations along the river, with the phytoplankton growth rate being the most influential parameter. Nitrogen and phosphorus transformation processes were more sensitive in winter, while chlorophyll-a and dissolved oxygen parameters showed higher sensitivity in summer.

To investigate the degree of influence of these parameters on calculation of models of land subsidence and ground fissures, Morris' global sensitivity analysis, combined with local sensitivity analysis, was applied. The accuracy of soil parameter sensitivity analysis is related closely to selection of the calculation model used. Based on Biot's consolidation theory, and combined with the nonlinear rheological theory of soil, a three-dimensional full coupling mathematic model was established to simulate land subsidence and ground fissures, in which the constitutive relation in Biot's consolidation theory was extended to viscoelastic plasticity. The dynamic relationships of soil parameters (porosity, permeability coefficient, parameters of soil deformation) accompanied by changes in the stress field were also considered. Consequently, this model conforms to actual conditions in the field. Nantong, Jiangsu Province in China, was selected to simulate and calculate land subsidence and ground fissures using this model, and the soil parameters' sensitivities were analyzed. The results showed that elastic modulus, E, cohesion, c, and the specific weight of soil, lambda, have a significant influence on land subsidence and ground fissures, with the influence of the friction angle, phi, on land subsidence, and of Poisson's ratio, m, on ground fissures taking second place.

To achieve these goals, a sensitivity and uncertainty analysis of modeling output is required. Based on the data collected at a long-term observation site with a -year rice-bean planting history, two global sensitivity analysis (SA) methods and six uncertainty analysis (UA) methods were applied and compared for the DeNitrification-DeComposition (DNDC) model to simulate inter-annual SOC changes (dSOC). Morris and Sobol' SA methods were used to identify the most influential parameters, and then the dSOC uncertainty intervals estimated by Morris, Sobol', Morris and a joint use of Monte Carlo (MC) with the five most sensitive parameters considered (Morris-MC-Fac), Morris and a joint use of MC with the four most sensitive parameters considered (Morris-MC-Fac), DNDC embedded Most Sensitive Factor method (DNDC-MSF), and the user-modified Most Sensitive Factor method with the five most sensitive parameters considered (MSF-user-Fac) were compared. Sensitivity analysis results indicated that the Morris and Sobol' methods produced similar sensitivity indices for  DNDC model input parameters. The initial SOC, bulk density, amount of manure applied, ratio of crop residue incorporated into soils, and amount of chemical fertilizer applied are the five most influential parameters on dSOC uncertainty at the site. In our case, Morris is recommended for a pure sensitivity analysis due to its low model running cost compared to that of Sobol'. Among the six uncertainty analysis methods, the Sobol' estimated uncertainty result is considered the most reliable, followed by that estimated with Morris-MC-Fac, MSF-user-Fac, Morris-MC-Fac, Morris, and DNDC-MSF. DNDC-MSF has the lowest model running cost, followed by Morris, MSF-user-Fac, Sobol', Morris-MC-Fac, and Morris-MC-Fac: Considering both the reliability of the uncertainty analysis results and the model running costs, MSF-user-Fac is the most efficient. However, it should be noted that MSF-user-Fac is not suitable for models in which the input parameters and modeling outputs are not monotonically related. For the latter models, Sobol' is a better choice.

However, the method is computationally expensive and suffers from premature convergence when level increases. To solve the two problems, this paper presents an advanced version of gravitational search algorithm (GSA), namely hybrid algorithm of GSA with genetic algorithm (GA) (GSA-GA) for multi-level thresholding. In GSA-GA, when premature convergence occurred, the roulette selection and discrete mutation operators of GA are introduced to diversify the population and escape from premature convergence. The introduction of these operators therefore promotes GSA-GA to perform faster and more accurate multi-level image thresholding. In this paper, two common criteria () entropy and () between-class variance were utilized as fitness functions. Experiments have been performed on six test images using various numbers of thresholds. The experimental results were compared with standard GSA and three state-of-art GSA variants.

At the global scale, the modelled uncertainty range of agricultural land-use change covers observed land-use change. Spatial patterns of cropland change at the country level are simulated less satisfactorily, but temporal trends of cropland change in large agricultural nations were replicated by the model. A variance-based global sensitivity analysis showed that uncertainties in the input parameters representing to consumption preferences are important for changes in global agricultural areas. However, uncertainties in technological change had the largest effect on cereal yields and changes in global agricultural area. Uncertainties related to technological change in developing countries were most important for modelling the extent of cropland.

But how reliable are the index rankings? Validation of indices with external reference data has posed a persistent challenge in large part because social vulnerability is multidimensional and not directly observable. This article applies global sensitivity analyses to internally validate the methods used in the most common social vulnerability index designs: deductive, hierarchical, and inductive. Uncertainty analysis is performed to assess the robustness of index ranks when reasonable alternative index configurations are modeled. The hierarchical design was found to be the most accurate, while the inductive model was the most precise. Sensitivity analysis is employed to understand which decisions in the vulnerability index construction process have the greatest influence on the stability of output rankings. The deductive index ranks are found to be the most sensitive to the choice of transformation method, hierarchical models to the selection of weighting scheme, and inductive indices to the indicator set and scale of analysis.

A key to sustaining systems using degraded irrigation waters is salinity management. Advanced simulation models and decision support tools can aid in the design and management of water reuse systems, but at present model predictions and related management recommendations contain significant uncertainty. Sensitivity analyses can help characterize and reduce uncertainties by revealing which parameter variations or uncertainties have the greatest impact on model outputs. In this work, the elementary effects method was used to obtain global sensitivity analyses of UNSATCHEM seasonal simulations of forage corn (Zea mays L.) production with differing irrigation rates and water compositions. Sensitivities were determined with respect to four model outcomes: crop yield, average root zone salinity, water leaching fraction, and salt leaching fraction. For a multiple-season, quasi-steady scenario, the sensitivity analysis found that overall the most important model parameters were the plant salt tolerance parameters, followed by the solute dispersivity. For a single-season scenario with irrigation scheduling based on soil water deficit, soil hydraulic parameters were the most important; the computed salt leaching fraction was also strongly affected by the initial ionic composition of the exchange phase because of its impact on mineral precipitation. In general, parameter sensitivities depend of the specifics of a given modeling scenario, and procedures for routine use of models for site-specific degraded irrigation water management should include site-specific uncertainty and sensitivity analyses. The elementary effects method used in this work is a useful approach for obtaining parameter sensitivity information at relatively low computational cost.",,"Skaggs, TH|Suarez, DL|Corwin, DL",VADOSE ZONE JOURNAL,,10.2136/vzj2013.09.0171

Global sensitivity analysis methods have been widely used to identify important processes for system model development and improvement. The existing methods of global sensitivity analysis only consider parametric uncertainty, and are not capable of handling model uncertainty caused by multiple process models that arise from competing hypotheses about one or more processes. To address this problem, this study develops a new method to probe model output sensitivity to competing process models by integrating model averaging methods with variance-based global sensitivity analysis. A process sensitivity index is derived as a single summary measure of relative process importance, and the index includes variance in model outputs caused by uncertainty in both process models and their parameters. For demonstration, the new index is used to assign importance to the processes of recharge and geology in a synthetic study of groundwater reactive transport modeling. The recharge process is simulated by two models that convert precipitation to recharge, and the geology process is simulated by two models of hydraulic conductivity. Each process model has its own random parameters. The new process sensitivity index is mathematically general, and can be applied to a wide range of problems in hydrology and beyond. Plain Language Summary If we have only one model, we always know how to identify the important factors of the models. However, if there are multiple models, it is not always clear how to identify the important factors. The factors important to one model may not be important to another model. It is necessary to develop a method that can identify important factors not for a single model but for multiple models. This study aims at resolving this problem by developing a mathematically rigorous method to provide a single summary measure for identifying important factors in the face of competing models. This is called multi-model process sensitivity analysis, and the mathematical measure is called process sensitivity index. The new index is demonstrated using a numerical example of groundwater reactive transport modeling with two recharge models and two geology models. The multimodel process sensitivity analysis has a wide range of applications in hydrologic and environmental modeling.",,"Dai, H|Ye, M|Walker, AP|Chen, XY",WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,,10.1002/2016WR019715

The relative contribution of each of these factors must be evaluated in order to choose an appropriate ensemble of future scenarios for water resources planning. In this study variance-based global sensitivity analysis and Monte Carlo filtering were used to evaluate the relative sensitivity of projected changes in precipitation (P), ET, and water deficit (defined here as P-ET) to choice of GCM, ET estimation method, and RCP trajectory over the continental United States (US) for two distinct future periods: - (future period ) and - (future period ). A total of  GCMs,  ET methods, and  RCP trajectories were used to quantify the range of future projections and estimate the relative sensitivity of future projections to each of these factors. In general, for all regions of the continental US, changes in future precipitation are most sensitive to the choice of GCM, while changes in future ET are most sensitive to the choice of ET estimation method. For changes in future water deficit, the choice of GCM is the most influential factor in the cool season (December-March), and the choice of ET estimation method is most important in the warm season (May-October) for all regions except the Southeast US, where GCMs and ET have approximately equal influence throughout most of the year. Although the choice of RCP trajectory is generally less important than the choice of GCM or ET method, the impact of RCP trajectory increases in future period  over future period  for all factors. Monte Carlo filtering results indicate that particular GCMs and ET methods drive the projection of wetter or drier future conditions much more than RCP trajectory; however, the set of GCMs and ET methods that produce wetter or drier projections varies substantially by region. Results of this study indicate that, in addition to using an ensemble of GCMs and several RCP trajectories, a range of regionally relevant ET estimation methods should be used to develop a robust range of future conditions for water resources planning under climate change.",,"Chang, S|Graham, WD|Hwang, S|Munoz-Carpena, R",HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES,,10.5194/hess-20-3245-2016

This paper presents a sensitivity and identifiability analysis of model parameters that influence stream flow generation in SWAT. The analysis was focused on evaluating the sensitivity of the parameters in different climatic settings, temporal scales and flow regimes. The global sensitivity analysis (GSA) technique based on classical decomposition of variance, Sobol', was employed in this study. The results of the study indicate that modeled stream flow show varying sensitivity to parameters in different climatic settings. The results also suggest that the identifiability of a parameter for a given watershed is a major concern in calibrating the model for the specific watershed, as it might lead to equifinality of parameters. The SWAT model parameters show varying sensitivity in different years of simulation suggesting the requirement for dynamic updation of parameters during the simulation. The sensitivity of parameters during various flow regimes (low, medium and high flow) is also found to be uneven, which suggests the significance of a multi-criteria approach for the calibration of models."," Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Cibin, R|Sudheer, KP|Chaubey, I",HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,global sensitivity analysis identifiability analysis sobol' method swat,10.1002/hyp.7568

The Root Zone Water Quality Model (RZWQM) has been subjected to various sensitivity analyses; however, in most of these efforts a local sensitivity analysis method was implemented, the nonlinear response was neglected, and the dependency among parameters was not examined. In this study we employed a comprehensive global sensitivity analysis to quantify the contribution of  model input parameters (including  hydrological parameters and  nitrogen cycle parameters) on the uncertainty of key RZWQM outputs relevant to raspberry row crops in Abbotsford, BC, Canada. Specifically,  model outputs that capture various vertical-spatial and temporal domains were investigated. A rank transformation method was used to account for the nonlinear behavior of the model. The variance of the model outputs was decomposed into correlated and uncorrelated partial variances to provide insight into parameter dependency and interaction. The results showed that, in general, the field capacity (soil water content at -  kPa) in upper  cm of the soil horizon had the greatest contribution (>%) to the estimate of the water flux and evapotranspiration uncertainty. The most influential parameters affecting the simulation of soil nitrate content, mineralization, denitrification, nitrate leaching and plant nitrogen uptake were the transient coefficient of fast to intermediate humus pool, the carbon to nitrogen ratio of the fast humus pool, the organic matter decay rate in fast humus pool, and field capacity. The correlated contribution to the model output uncertainty was <% for the set of parameters investigated. The findings from this effort were utilized in two calibration case studies to demonstrate the utility of this global sensitivity analysis to reduce the risk of over-parameterization, and to identify the vertical location of observations that were the most effective to use as RZWQM calibration targets when water flux estimates are a key focus.", Crown Copyright (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.

This paper proposes a new method for consistent estimation of multiple land surface parameters and aerosol optical depth (ACID) from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) TOA reflectance data. Soil, vegetation canopy, and atmospheric radiative transfer models were coupled, and a global sensitivity analysis of the coupled model was performed to identify the influential parameters from satellite observations. The most influential parameters, including leaf area index (LAI) and aerosol optical depth (AOD), were simultaneously retrieved from MODIS TOA reflectance data and then provided as input to the coupled soil-canopy-atmosphere radiative transfer model to calculate land surface reflectance, incident photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), land surface albedo, and the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FAPAR). The retrieved land surface parameters and AOD were compared with the corresponding MODIS, Global Land Surface Satellite (GLASS), GEOV, and Multi-angle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR) products and validated by ground measurements from seven sites with different vegetation types.

Using a global sensitivity analysis, this study assessed the implications of baseline climate conditions on the sensitivity of PET to a large range of plausible changes in temperature (T), relative humidity (RH), solar radiation (R-s) and wind speed (u(z)). The analysis was conducted at  Australian locations representing different climatic zones, using the Penman-Monteith and Priestley-Taylor PET models. Results from both models suggest that the baseline climate can have a substantial impact on overall PET sensitivity. In particular, approximately -fold greater changes in PET were observed in cool-climate energy-limited locations compared to other locations in Australia, indicating the potential for elevated water loss as a result of increasing actual evapotranspiration (AET) in these locations. The two PET models consistently indicated temperature to be the most important variable for PET, but showed large differences in the relative importance of the remaining climate variables. In particular for the Penman-Monteith model, wind and relative humidity were the second-most important variables for dry and humid catchments, respectively, whereas for the Priestley-Taylor model solar radiation was the second-most important variable, with the greatest influence in warmer catchments. This information can be useful to inform the selection of suitable PET models to estimate future PET for different climate conditions, providing evidence on both the structural plausibility and input uncertainty for the alternative models.",,"Guo, D|Westra, S|Maier, HR",HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES,,10.5194/hess-21-2107-2017

On the basis of this shared behaviour, rainfall products with questionable quantitative precipitation estimation (QPE) are excluded.

A novel approach is taken that translates direct losses of both capital and labor into production losses using the Cobb-Douglas production function, aiming at improved consistency in loss accounting. The recovery of the economy is modeled using a hybrid input-output model and applied to the port region of Rotterdam, using six different flood events (/ up to /,). This procedure allows gaining a better insight regarding the consequences of both high- and low-probability floods. The results show that in terms of expected annual damage, direct losses remain more substantial relative to the indirect losses (approximately % larger), but for low-probability events the indirect losses outweigh the direct losses. Furthermore, we explored parameter uncertainty using a global sensitivity analysis, and varied critical assumptions in the modeling framework related to, among others, flood duration and labor recovery, using a scenario approach. Our findings have two important implications for disaster modelers and practitioners. First, high-probability events are qualitatively different from low-probability events in terms of the scale of damages and full recovery period. Second, there are substantial differences in parameter influence between high-probability and low-probability flood modeling.

Metamodel-based techniques have been developed in order to replace the CPU time-expensive computer code with an inexpensive mathematical function, which predicts the computer code output. The common metamodel-based sensitivity analysis methods are well suited for computer codes with scalar outputs. However, in the environmental domain, as in many areas of application, the numerical model outputs are often spatial maps, which may also vary with time. In this paper, we introduce an innovative method to obtain a spatial map of Sobol' indices with a minimal number of numerical model computations. It is based upon the functional decomposition of the spatial output onto a wavelet basis and the metamodeling of the wavelet coefficients by the Gaussian process. An analytical example is presented to clarify the various steps of our methodology.

The framework relies on the identification of sources of uncertainties via global sensitivity analysis, followed by the quantification of their impact on performance evaluation metrics via uncertainty analysis. Finally, stochastic programming is applied to drive the process development efforts forward subject to these uncertainties. The framework is evaluated on four different process configurations for cellulosic ethanol production including simultaneous saccharification and co-fermentation and separate hydrolysis and co-fermentation (SSCF and SHCF, respectively) technologies in different operation modes (continuous and continuous with recycle). The results showed that parameters related to pretreatment (e.g. activation energy of the reaction for glucose production, order of the reaction. etc.), hydrolysis (inhibition constant for xylose on conversion of cellulose and cellobiose, etc.) and co-fermentation (ethanol yield on xylose, inhibition constant on microbial growth, etc.), are the most significant sources of uncertainties affecting the unit production cost of ethanol with a standard deviation of up to . USD/gal-ethanol. Further stochastic optimization demonstrated the options for further reduction of the production costs with different processing configurations, reaching a reduction of up to % in the production cost in the SHCF configuration compared to the base case operation. Further, the framework evaluated here for uncertainties in the technical domain, can also be used to evaluate the impact of market uncertainties (feedstock prices, selling price of ethanol, etc.) and political uncertainties (such as subsidies) on the economic feasibility of lignocellulosic ethanol production.

A hybrid application of order reduction methods, introduced previously, has been shown to effectively reduce the computational cost required to find a reduced order model with quantifiable bounds on the reduction errors, which is achieved by hybridizing the application of local variational and global sampling methods for order reduction. The method requires the evaluation of first-order derivatives of pseudo-responses with respect to input parameters and the ability to perturb input parameters within their user-specified ranges of variations. The derivatives are employed to find a subspace that captures all possible response variations resulting from all possible parameter variations with quantifiable accuracy. This paper extends the applicability of this methodology to multi-component models. This is achieved by employing a hybrid methodology to enable the transfer of sensitivity information between the various components in an efficient manner precluding the need for a global sensitivity analysis procedure, which is often envisaged to be computationally intractable. Finally, we introduce a new measure of conditioning for the subspace employed for order reduction. Although, the developments are general, they are applied here to smoothly behaving functions only. Extension to non-smooth functions will be addressed in a future article.

When combined with sensitivity analysis, PVA yields insights into the effects of parameter and model structure uncertainty. This helps researchers prioritize efforts for further data collection so that model improvements are efficient and helps managers prioritize conservation and management actions. Usually, sensitivity is analyzed by varying one input parameter at a time and observing the influence that variation has over model outcomes. This approach does not account for interactions among parameters. Global sensitivity analysis (GSA) overcomes this limitation by varying several model inputs simultaneously. Then, regression techniques allow measuring the importance of input-parameter uncertainties.In many conservation applications, the goal of demographic modeling is to assess how different scenarios of impact or management cause changes in a population. This is challenging because the uncertainty of input-parameter values can be confounded with the effect of impacts and management actions. We developed a GSA method that separates model outcome uncertainty resulting from parameter uncertainty from that resulting from projected ecological impacts or simulated management actions, effectively separating the  main questions that sensitivity analysis asks. We applied this method to assess the effects of predicted sea-level rise on Snowy Plover (Charadrius nivosus). A relatively small number of replicate models (approximately ) resulted in consistent measures of variable importance when not trying to separate the effects of ecological impacts from parameter uncertainty. However, many more replicate models (approximately ) were required to separate these effects.

Satisfying these needs will require improved theory, improved models and improved frameworks for making and evaluating predictions.

More realistic representations of real-world thresholds, nonlinearities and feedbacks motivates the use of more complex models as well as the consequent need for more rigorous evaluations of model performance.

Two sources of uncertainty were taken into account and compared: () uncertainty concerning the parameters of the governing equation; () uncertainty concerning the forcing functions. The mean annual concentrations of Dissolved Inorganic Nitrogen (DIN) was regarded as the model output, as it represents the largest fraction of the Total Dissolved Nitrogen, TDN, for which the current Italian legislation sets a quality target in the lagoon of Venice. A local sensitivity analysis was initially used, so as to rank the parameters and provide an initial estimation of the uncertainty, which is a result of an imperfect knowledge of the dynamic of the system. This uncertainty was compared with that induced by an imperfect knowledge of the loads of Nitrogen, which represent the main forcing functions. On the basis of the results of the local analysis, the most important parameters and loads were then taken as the sources of uncertainty, in an attempt to assess their relative contributions. The global uncertainty and sensitivity analyses were carried out by means of a sampling-based Monte Carlo method. The results of the subsequent input-output regression analysis suggest that the variance in the model output could be partitioned among the sources of uncertainty, in accordance with a linear model. Based on this model, % of the variance in the mean annual concentration of DIN was accounted for by the uncertainty in the parameters which specify the dynamics of the phytoplankton and zooplankton, and only % by the uncertainties in the three main Nitrogen sources.

Initially, various conventional error criterions are considered, the PI controller parameters for a two-area power system are optimized employing GSA and the effect of objective function on system performance is analyzed. Then GSA control parameters are tuned by carrying out multiple runs of algorithm for each control parameter variation. After that PS is employed to fine tune the best solution provided by GSA. Further, modifications in the objective function and controller structure are introduced and the controller parameters are optimized employing the proposed hybrid GSA and PS (hGSA-PS) approach. The superiority of the proposed approach is demonstrated by comparing the results with some recently published modern heuristic optimization techniques such as firefly algorithm (FA), differential evolution (DE), bacteria foraging optimization algorithm (BFOA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), hybrid BFOA-PSO, NSGA-II and genetic algorithm (GA) for the same interconnected power system.

Conditional-value-at-risk minimization shows how the optimal decision depends on the risk inclination of the decision-maker; a risk-neutral decision maker would choose a basic optimal production scale of  million liters (ML) of ethanol per year, while a risk-averse decision-maker might prefer to choose a capacity % less.

These were obtained by applying the Hartree-Fock-Gauss generalized simulated annealing (GSA) method-a modified form of the GSA algorithm. The new bases were generated through optimization of the atomic electronic energy functional with regards to the linear combination of atomic orbitals-molecular orbital (LCAO-MO) coefficients, and exponent and contraction coefficients of the primitive Gaussian functions, simultaneously. These new bases were tested by performing calculations of the ground state energy of the Be atom, and the ground state energy and permanent electrical dipole moment of the LiH molecule, using the multi-reference Hartree-Fock (HF) configuration interaction method-a multi-reference method based on multiple HF solutions. In addition, multi-reference HF configuration interaction calculations were performed for the Be atom using the standard double-zeta, triple-zeta and polarized double-zeta bases.

The study goal was to simulate soil water dynamics in response to canal stage raises considering uncertainty in measured soil water content. Water and Agrochemicals in the soil, crop and Vadose Environment (WAVE) was applied to simulate unsaturated flow above a shallow aquifer. Global sensitivity analysis was performed to identify model input factors with the greatest influence on predicted soil water content. Nash-Sutcliffe increased and Root Mean Square Error reduced when uncertainties in measured data were considered in goodness-of-fit calculations using measurement probability distributions and probable asymmetric error boundaries, implying that appropriate model performance evaluation should be carried out using uncertainty ranges instead of single values. Although uncertainty in the experimental measured data limited evaluation of the absolute predictions by the model, WAVE was found a useful exploratory tool for estimating temporal variation in soil water content. Visual analysis of soil water content time series under proposed changes in canal stage management indicated that sites with land surface elevation of less than .-m NGVD were predicted to periodically experience saturated conditions in the root zone and shortening of the growing season if canal stage is raised more than  cm and maintained at this level. The models developed could be combined with high-resolution digital elevation models in future studies to identify areas with the greatest risk of experiencing saturated root zone. The study also highlighted the need to incorporate measurement uncertainty when evaluating performance of unsaturated flow models."," Copyright (C) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Kisekka, I|Migliaccio, KW|Munoz-Carpena, R|Schaffer, B|Khare, Y",HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,soil water measurement uncertainty vadose zone wave root zone saturation,10.1002/hyp.10173

The study rationale consisted in a comprehensive evaluation of the model and the formulation of guidelines for model simplification and efficient calibration. The global analysis comprehended a Morris screening followed by a variance-based Extended Fourier Amplitude Sensitivity Test (EFAST) under diverse environmental conditions for maize, winter wheat and rice. The analysis involved twenty-two different climate-crop-soil-meteorology combinations. The main objectives were to distinguish the model's influential and non-influential parameters, and to examine the yield output sensitivity. For the AquaCrop model, a number of non-influential parameters could be identified. Making these parameters fixed would be a step towards model simplification. Also, a list of influential parameters was identified. Despite the dependence of parameter ranking on environmental conditions, guiding principles for priority parameters were formulated for calibration in diverse conditions, valuable to model users. For this model that focuses on modelling yield response to water, parameters describing crop responses to water stress were not often among those showing highest sensitivity. Instead, particular root and soil parameters, relevant in the determination of water availability, were influential under various conditions and merit attention during calibration. The considerations made in this study about sensitivity analysis method (Morris vs. EFAST), prior parameter ranges, target functions and ranking variation according to environmental conditions can be extrapolated to other conditions and models, if done with the necessary precaution.

The nuclides are retarded as they diffuse in the porous rock matrix and stagnant zones in the fracture. The Laplace transform and similarity transform techniques are applied to solve the model. The analytical solution to the nuclide concentrations at the fracture outlet is governed by nine parameters representing different mechanisms acting on nuclide transport through a fracture, including diffusion into the rock matrices, diffusion into the stagnant water zone, chain decay and hydrodynamic dispersion. Furthermore, to assess how sensitive the results are to parameter uncertainties, the Sobol method is applied in variance-based global sensitivity analyses of the model output. The Sobol indices show how uncertainty in the model output is apportioned to the uncertainty in the model input. This method takes into account both direct effects and interaction effects between input parameters. The simulation results suggest that in the case of pulse injections, ignoring the effect of a stagnant water zone can lead to significant errors in the time-of-first arrival and the peak value of the nuclides. Likewise, neglecting the parent and modeling its daughter as a single stable species can result in a significant overestimation of the peak value of the daughter nuclide. It is also found that as the dispersion increases, the early arrival time and the peak time of the daughter decrease while the peak value increases. More importantly, the global sensitivity analysis reveals that for time periods greater than a few thousand years, the uncertainty of the model output is more sensitive to the values of the individual parameters than to the interaction between them. Moreover, if one tries to evaluate the true values of the input parameters at the same cost and effort, the determination of priorities should follow a certain sequence.", (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Because natural systems show great variability and complexity with respect to soil, land cover, topography, precipitation, there exist large uncertainties and heterogeneities in model input factors. In this paper, we explore the possibility of using global sensitivity analysis (GSA) technique to study the influence of heterogeneity and uncertainties in model inputs on zero order radiative transfer (ZRT) model and to quantify interactions between parameters. GSA technique is based on decomposition of variance and can handle nonlinear and nonmonotonic functions. We direct our analyses toward growing agricultural fields of corn and soybean in two different regions, Iowa, USA (SMEX) and Winnipeg, Canada (SMAPVEX). We noticed that, there exists a spatio-temporal variation in parameter interactions under different soil moisture and vegetation conditions. Radiative Transfer Model (RTM) behaves more non-linearly in SMEX and linearly in SMAPVEX, with average parameter interactions of % in SMEX and % in SMAPVEX. Also, parameter interactions increased with vegetation water content (VWC) and roughness conditions. Interestingly, soil moisture shows an exponentially decreasing sensitivity function whereas parameters such as root mean square height (RMS height) and vegetation water content show increasing sensitivity with . v/v increase in soil moisture range. Overall, considering the SMAPVEX fields to be water rich environment (due to higher observed SM) and SMEX fields to be energy rich environment (due to lower SM and wide ranges of TSURF), our results indicate that first order as well as interactions between the parameters change with water and energy rich environments.",,"Neelam, M|Mohanty, BP",WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,soil moisture radiative transfer remote sensing sensitivity smex02 smapvex12,10.1002/2014WR016534

Many-query applications such as sensitivity analysis or model calibration usually require a large number of model evaluations leading to high computational demand. This often limits the feasibility of rigorous analyses. Here we present a fully automated sequential screening method that selects only informative parameters for a given model output. The method requires a number of model evaluations that is approximately  times the number of model parameters. It was tested using the mesoscale hydrologic model mHM in three hydrologically unique European river catchments. It identified around  informative parameters out of , with different informative parameters in each catchment. The screening method was evaluated with subsequent analyses using all  as well as only the informative parameters. Subsequent Sobol's global sensitivity analysis led to almost identical results yet required % fewer model evaluations after screening. mHM was calibrated with all and with only informative parameters in the three catchments. Model performances for daily discharge were equally high in both cases with Nash-Sutcliffe efficiencies above .. Calibration using only the informative parameters needed just one third of the number of model evaluations.

The maximum permissible inflow to WWTPs depends not only on the settleability of activated sludge in secondary settling tanks (SSTs) but also on the hydraulic behaviour of SSTs. The present study investigates the impacts of ideal and non-ideal flow (dry and wet weather) and settling (good settling and bulking) boundary conditions on the sensitivity of WWTP model outputs to uncertainties intrinsic to the one-dimensional (-D) SST model structures and parameters. We identify the critical sources of uncertainty in WWTP models through global sensitivity analysis (GSA) using the Benchmark simulation model No.  in combination with first- and second-order -D SST models. The results obtained illustrate that the contribution of settling parameters to the total variance of the key WWTP process outputs significantly depends on the influent flow and settling conditions. The magnitude of the impact is found to vary, depending on which type of -D SST model is used. Therefore, we identify and recommend potential parameter subsets for WWTP model calibration, and propose optimal choice of -D SST models under different flow and settling boundary conditions. Additionally, the hydraulic parameters in the second-order SST model are found significant under dynamic wet-weather flow conditions. These results highlight the importance of developing a more mechanistic based flow-dependent hydraulic sub-model in second-order -D SST models in the future. (C) ", Elsevier Ltd.

The approach consists of a combination of the Generalized Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation technique (GLUE) and Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA). The method is based on multiple model evaluations. The GSA is a quantitative, model independent approach and is based on estimating the fractional contribution of each input factor to the variance of the model output, also accounting for interaction terms. In GLUE, the model runs are classified according to a likelihood measure, conditioning each run to observations. In calibration procedures, strong interaction is observed between model parameters, due to model over-parameterization. The use of likelihood measures allows an estimate of the posterior joint pdf of parameters. By performing a GSA to the likelihood measure, input factors mainly driving model runs with good fit to data are identified. Moreover GSA allows highlighting the basic features of the interaction structure.

It has been suggested that disturbance by noise is responsible for a substantial part of the damage to human health. However, no recommended approach to address noise impacts was proposed by the handbook for life cycle assessment (LCA) of the European Commission, nor are characterisation factors (CFs) and appropriate inventory data available in commonly used databases. This contribution provides CFs to allow for the quantification of noise impacts on human health in the LCA framework. Noise propagation standards and international reports on acoustics and noise impacts were used to define the model parameters. Spatial data was used to calculate spatially-defined CFs in the form of -by--km maps. The results of this analysis were combined with data from the literature to select input data for representative archetypal situations of emission (e.g. urban day with a frequency of  Hz, rural night at  Hz, etc.). A total of  spatial and  archetypal CFs were produced to evaluate noise impacts at a European level (i.e. EU). The possibility of a user-defined characterisation factor was added to support the possibility of portraying the situation of full availability of information, as well as a highly-localised impact analysis. A Monte Carlo-based quantitative global sensitivity analysis method was applied to evaluate the importance of the input factors in determining the variance of the output. The factors produced are ready to be implemented in the available LCA databases and software.

CRIV is usually calibrated with other parameters by history matching. However, the inverse problem of groundwater models is often ill-posed and individual model parameters are likely to be poorly constrained. Ill-posedness can be addressed by Tikhonov regularization with prior knowledge on parameter values. The difficulty with a lumped parameter like CRIV, which cannot be measured in the field, is to find suitable initial and regularization values. Several formulations have been proposed for the estimation of CRIV from physical parameters. However, these methods are either too simple to provide a reliable estimate of CRIV, or too complex to be easily implemented by groundwater modelers. This paper addresses the issue with a flexible and operational tool based on a D numerical model in a local vertical cross section, where the river conductance is computed from selected geometric and hydrodynamic parameters. Contrary to other approaches, the grid size of the regional model and the anisotropy of the aquifer hydraulic conductivity are also taken into account. A global sensitivity analysis indicates the strong sensitivity of CRIV to these parameters. This enhancement for the prior estimation of CRIV is a step forward for the calibration and uncertainty analysis of surface-subsurface models. It is especially useful for modeling objectives that require CRIV to be well known such as conjunctive surface water-groundwater use.",,"Cousquer, Y|Pryet, A|Flipo, N|Delbart, C|Dupuy, A",GROUNDWATER,,10.1111/gwat.12492

In the southwestern part of South Korea, a parallel triple-reservoir system was constructed by blocking the mouth of three different rivers (Yeongsan, Okcheon, and Kumja), which were then interconnected using two open channels. This system has experienced a deterioration in water quality due to pollutants accumulated from the upper watershed, and has continually discharged pollutant loads to the outer ocean. Therefore, the objective of this study is to establish an effective dam operation plan for reducing nutrient loads released from the integrated reservoir. In this study, the CE-QUAL-W model, which is a -dimentional hydrodynamic and water quality model, was applied to predict the pollutant load released from each reservoir in response to different flow scenarios for the interconnecting channel. The model was calibrated using two novel methods: a sensitivity analysis to determine meaningful model parameters, and a pattern search to optimize the parameters. From the scenario analysis using flow control, it was determined that the total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) loadings could be reduced by .% and .%, respectively, under the optimal channel flow scenario by regulating the chlorophyll-a concentration in the reservoir. The results confirm that effective dam operation could contribute to a decrease in pollutant loads in the receiving seawater body.

However, little is known about OM characteristics particularly the dissolved fraction in the Bengal Delta Plain aquifers - one of the worst As impacted regions in the world. Ongoing investigations in As-rich aquifers in Nadia district (West Bengal, India) indicate presence of arsenite {As(III)} oxidizing bacterial communities in the Grey Sand Aquifers (GSA), but absent in Brown Sand Aquifers (BSA). In this study, we investigate the key differences in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) characteristics and its relationship with differences in elemental concentrations, distribution of biomarkers, and utilization of DOC by in situ microbial communities in BSA and GSA. We demonstrate a new approach using ENVITM C- DSK discs to pre-concentrate DOC from large volumes of water, and further extract the OM and separate it into different lipid fractions using the solid phase extraction technique. The aquifers show marked heterogeneity in terms of their DOC characteristics and elemental profiles irrespective of their grey or brown color. DOC indicates variable inputs of terrestrial derived OM sources, and OM derived from decomposition and/or microbial cellular components. DOC in the aquifers consist of predominantly n-alkanoic acids (similar to %) followed by n-alkanes and n-alcohols. The GSAs indicate high iron (Fe) and manganese (Mn) concentrations, and presence of mature petroleum derived hydrocarbons in DOC. BSA has comparatively lower concentrations of Fe and Mn, and shows absence of mature hydrocarbons in DOC. Experiments in presence of indigenous bacteria from groundwater with DOC lipid extracts as the sole carbon source indicate higher growth in the GSA samples implying preferential use of DOC.

The analysis is conducted with the variance-based approach of Sobol/Saltelli where first and total sensitivity indices are estimated. The results of the framework can be used in a loop for model improvement, parameter estimation or model simplification. The framework is applied to SWAP, a  hydrological model for the transport of water, solutes and heat in unsaturated and saturated soils. The sources of uncertainty are grouped in five main classes: model structure (soil discretization), input (weather data), time-varying (crop) parameters, scalar parameters (soil properties) and observations (measured soil moisture). For each source of uncertainty, different realizations are created based on direct monitoring activities. Uncertainty of evapotranspiration, soil moisture in the root zone and bottom fluxes below the root zone are considered in the analysis. The results show that the sources of uncertainty are different for each output considered and it is necessary to consider multiple output variables for a proper assessment of the model. Improvements on the performance of the model can be achieved reducing the uncertainty in the observations, in the soil parameters and in the weather data. Overall, the study shows the capability of the GPF to quantify the relative contribution of the different sources of uncertainty and to identify the priorities required to improve the performance of the model. The proposed framework can be extended to a wide variety of modelling applications, also when direct measurements of model output are not available. (C) ", Elsevier Ltd.

These models are classified in two types of fuzzy models, where the first type is intended to account for the effect of changes in catchment wetness and the second type incorporates seasonality as a source of non-linearity. The sensitivity analysis is performed using two global sensitivity analysis methods, namely Regional Sensitivity Analysis and Sobol's variance decomposition. The data of six catchments from different geographical locations and sizes are used in the sensitivity analysis. The sensitivity of the model parameters is analysed in terms of several measures of goodness of fit, assessing the model performance from different points of view. These measures include the Nash-Sutcliffe criteria, volumetric errors and peak errors. The results show that the sensitivity of the model parameters depends on both the catchment type and the measure used to assess the model performance.",,"Jacquin, AP|Shamseldin, AY",HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES,,10.5194/hess-13-41-2009

During the period, ozone concentrations around  ppb were observed for  days. Two sets of diagnostic wind fields were constructed by using observations from the weather stations operated by the Korea Meteorological Administration. One set of wind fields utilized only observations from the surface weather stations (SWS) and the other set also utilized observations from the automatic weather stations (AWS) that were more densely distributed than the SWS. The results showed that utilizing observations from the AWS could represent fine variations in the wind field such as those caused by topography. A better wind field gave a more reasonable spatial distribution of ozone concentrations. The model performance of ozone prediction was also improved to some extent, but only marginally acceptable owing to large day-to-day variations, Overshoots of primary pollutants particularly for NO were observed as pollutants were accumulated where low wind speeds were maintained.

Dynamic sensitivity analysis aims at assessing the influence of the landslide properties on the time-dependent predictions (e.g. time series of landslide displacements). Yet, two major difficulties arise: () Global sensitivity analysis require running the landslide model a high number of times (> ,), which may become impracticable when the landslide model has a high computation time cost (> several hours); () Landslide model outputs are not scalar, but function of time, that is, they are n-dimensional vectors with n usually ranging from  to ,. In this article, I explore the use of a basis set expansion, such as principal component analysis, to reduce the output dimensionality to a few components, each of them being interpreted as a dominant mode of variation in the overall structure of the temporal evolution. The computationally intensive calculation of the Sobol' indices for each of these components are then achieved through meta-modelling, that is, by replacing the landslide model by a ""costless-to-evaluate"" approximation (e.g. a projection pursuit regression model). The methodology combining ""basis set expansion-meta-model-Sobol' indices"" is then applied to the Swiss La Frasse landslide to investigate the dynamic sensitivity analysis of the surface horizontal displacements to the slip surface properties during the pore pressure changes.

Chemicals are usually emitted locally but their impact can be felt both locally and globally, due to their chemical properties and persistence. The variability of environmental parameters in the emission compartment may affect the chemicals' fate and the exposure at different orders of magnitude. The assessment of the environmental fate of chemicals and the inherent spatial differentiation requires the use of multimedia models at various levels of complexity (from a simple box model to complex computational and high-spatial-resolution models). The objective of these models is to support ecological and human health risk assessment, by reducing the uncertainty of chemical impact assessments. The parameterisation of spatially resolved multimedia models is usually based on scenarios of evaluative environments, or on geographical resolutions related to administrative boundaries (e.g. countries/continents) or landscape areas (e.g. watersheds, eco-regions). The choice of the most appropriate scale and scenario is important from a management perspective, as a balance should be reached between a simplified approach and computationally intensive multimedia models. In this paper, which aims to go beyond the more traditional approach based on scale/resolution (cell, country, and basin), we propose and assess climate-based archetypes for the impact assessment of chemicals released in air. We define the archetypes based on the main drivers of spatial variability, which we systematically identify by adopting global sensitivity analysis techniques. A case study that uses the high resolution multimedia model MAPPE (Multimedia Assessment of Pollutant Pathways in the Environment) is presented. Results of the analysis showed that suitable archetypes should be both climate- and chemical-specific, as different chemicals (or groups of them) have different traits that influence their spatial variability. This hypothesis was tested by comparing the variability of the output of MAPPE for four different climatic zones on four different continents for four different chemicals (which represent different combinations of physical and chemical properties). Results showed the high suitability of climate-based archetypes in assessing the impacts of chemicals released in air. However, further research work is still necessary to test these findings.

While having been previously applied to various water-related and environmental modeling problems, no studies have used surrogate models for the analysis of LIDs. The aim of this research thus was to investigate the benefit of surrogate-based modeling in the numerical analysis of LIDs. The kriging technique was used to approximate the deterministic response of the widely used mechanistic model HYDRUS-D, which was employed to simulate the variably-saturated hydraulic behavior of a contained stormwater filter. The Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) index was used to compare the simulated and measured outflows and as the variable of interest for the construction of the response surface.

In particular, in the detritusphere pesticide degradation is accelerated by input of fresh organic carbon from litter into the adjacent soil. This observed priming effect suggests: (i) pesticide degradation is strongly coupled to carbon turnover, (ii) it is controlled by size and activity of the microbial community and (iii) sorption and transport of dissolved carbonaceous compounds and pesticides might regulate substrate availability and in turn decomposition processes. We present a new mechanistic D model (PEsticide degradation Coupled to CArbon turnover in the Detritusphere, PECCAD) which implements these hypotheses. The new model explicitly considers growth and activity of bacteria, fungi and specific pesticide degraders in response to substrate availability. Enhanced pesticide degradation due to availability of a second source of carbon (dissolved organic carbon) is implemented in the model structure via two mechanisms. First, additional substrate is utilized simultaneously with the pesticide by bacterial pesticide degraders resulting in an increase in their size and activity. Second, stimulation of fungal growth and activity by additional substrates leads directly to higher pesticide degradation via co-metabolism. Thus, PECCAD implicitly accounts for litter-stimulated production and activity of unspecific fungal enzymes responsible for co-metabolic pesticide degradation. With a global sensitivity analysis we identified high-leverage model parameters and input. In combination with appropriate experimental data, PECCAD can serve as a tool to elucidate regulation mechanisms of accelerated pesticide degradation in the detritusphere.",,"Pagel, H|Ingwersen, J|Poll, C|Kandeler, E|Streck, T",BIOGEOCHEMISTRY,soil organic matter mechanistic model biogeochemical interface priming effect carbon isotopes gene abundance,10.1007/s10533-013-9851-3

However, the results of LCA can be affected by parameter uncertainties. The rigorous treatment of such uncertainties is thus essential to improve decision-making based on the LCA. In this work, the Latin hypercube design of experiments (DOE) approach is proposed for global sensitivity analysis in LCA. In this novel approach, the LCA input parameters are used as the factors for the experimental design. The LCA of biodiesel from different feedstocks, namely, jatropha, waste cooking oil (WCO), and fish oil (FO), under the current conditions in Vietnam was chosen as a test case. The LCA focuses on the global warming potential (GWP), photochemical ozone formation potential (POFP), acidification potential (AP), and eutrophication potential (EP) of the biodiesel system. These impact categories were then combined into an overall environmental impact (OEI) score using the analytic hierarchy process (AHP). The effect of changes in the LCA model parameters on the OEI was then observed through computational experiments using a Latin hypercube design. From the computational experiments, the input parameters significantly affecting the results of LCA were identified, and a proxy polynomial regression model was derived to enable global sensitivity analysis to be performed. The results show that agricultural yield, oil content of jatropha seed, transesterification yield, total transportation, and biodiesel blending fraction are the factors that have significant effects on the OEI of jatropha biodiesel; biodiesel blend fraction and total transportation are significant in the case of WCO diesel, while the only significant effect factor in FO biodiesel case is biodiesel blend fraction.

It is often associated with runoff resulting from sealing and crusting, and soil properties such as soil detachability or soil aggregate stability have been used to express soil resistance to interrill erosion processes, i.e., interrill erodibility. From a literature review including more than fifteen erosion models, we have identified three main methods used to measure these properties: aggregate stability and splash cup detachability, methods performed in the laboratory using only a few grams of soil, and standard plot methods that are based on field plot measurements. This difference makes the parameters involved in assessing interrill erodibility dependent upon the scale and the hydrological processes involved and difficult to compare. According to the literature, the sensitivity of actual erosion models to interrill erodibility is lower than the sensitivity to hydrological properties and rill erodibility parameters.

To reduce the massive computational cost, a cheap-to-evaluate surrogate model is usually constructed to approximate and replace the expensive groundwater models in the GSA and UQ. Constructing an accurate surrogate requires actual model simulations on a number of parameter samples. Thus, a robust experimental design strategy is desired to locate informative samples so as to reduce the computational cost in surrogate construction and consequently to improve the efficiency in the GSA and UQ. In this study, we develop a Taylor expansion-based adaptive design (TEAD) that aims to build an accurate global surrogate model with a small training sample size. TEAD defines a novel hybrid score function to search informative samples, and a robust stopping criterion to terminate the sample search that guarantees the resulted approximation errors satisfy the desired accuracy. The good performance of TEAD in building global surrogate models is demonstrated in seven analytical functions with different dimensionality and complexity in comparison to two widely used experimental design methods.

Screening, as the qualitative method of GSA, is to identify and exclude non- or less-influential input variables in high-dimensional models. However, for non-parametric problems, there remains the challenging problem of finding an efficient screening procedure, as one needs to properly handle the non-parametric high-order interactions among input variables and keep the size of the screening experiment economically feasible. In this study, we design a novel screening approach based on analysis of variance decomposition of the model. This approach combines the virtues of run-size economy and model independence. The core idea is to choose a low-level complete orthogonal array to derive the sensitivity estimates for all input factors and their interactions with low cost, and then develop a statistical process to screen out the non-influential ones without assuming the effect-sparsity of the model.

Unfortunately, ATS can promote formation of low-vapor-pressure gases, which may undergo nucleation and condensation leading to formation of nucleation particles (NUP). The chemical nature and formation mechanism of these particles are only poorly explored. Using a novel mass spectrometric method, online measurements of low-vapor-pressure gases were performed for exhaust of a modern heavy-duty diesel engine operated with modem ATS and combusting low and ultralow sulfur fuels and also biofuel. It was observed that the gaseous sulfuric acid (GSA) concentration varied strongly, although engine operation was stable. However, the exhaust GSA was observed to be affected by fuel sulfur level, exhaust after-treatment, and driving conditions. Significant GSA concentrations were measured also when biofuel was used, indicating that GSA can be originated also from lubricant oil sulfur. Furthermore, accompanying NUP measurements and NUP model simulations were performed. We found that the exhaust GSA promotes NUP formation, but also organic (acidic) precursor gases can have a role.

In order to overcome this limitation, a modified Sobol' method for MCDA (Sobol'-MCDA) is introduced in this paper. The method has the following features: (i) it enables the stability or robustness of the relative ranking of two alternatives to be assessed in the light of changes in assessment criteria and stakeholder preferences; and (ii) it enables the sensitivity of the ranking of two alternatives to changes in assessment criteria and stakeholder preferences to be assessed. The approach is demonstrated for a water resources case study from the literature consisting of seven alternatives and ten assessment criteria. (C) ", Elsevier Ltd.

However, the high uncertainty commonly affecting stormwater runoff quality modelling also influences stormwater treatment models. This study identified the major sources of uncertainty when estimating the removal of copper and zinc in a retention pond and a biofilter by using a conceptual dynamic model which estimates MP partitioning between the dissolved and particulate phases as well as environmental fate based on substance-inherent properties. The two systems differ in their main removal processes (settling and filtration/sorption, respectively) and in the time resolution of the available measurements (composite samples and pollutographs). The most sensitive model factors, identified by using Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA), were related to the physical characteristics of the simulated systems (flow and water losses) and to the fate processes related to Total Suspended Solids (TSS). The model prediction bounds were estimated by using the Generalized Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation (GLUE) technique. Composite samples and pollutographs produced similar prediction bounds for the pond and the biofilter, suggesting a limited influence of the temporal resolution of samples on the model prediction bounds. GLUE highlighted model structural uncertainty when modelling the biofilter, due to disregard of plant-driven evapotranspiration, underestimation of sorption and neglect of oversaturation with respect to minerals/salts. The results of this study however illustrate the potential for the application of conceptual dynamic fate models base on substance-inherent properties, in combination with available datasets and statistical methods, to estimate the MP removal in different stormwater treatment systems and compare with environmental quality standards targeting the dissolved MP fraction.

It is based on a truncated Polynomial Chaos Expansion of the output whose coefficients are estimated by Partial Least Squares Regression. The method is applied to a computer model for heterogeneous canopies in arable crops, aimed to predict crop: weed competition for light.

It is based on a cascade of ingredients with growing computational complexity for both forward and reverse uncertainty propagation. The approach is merely geometric. It starts with a complexity-based splitting of the independent variables and the definition of a parametric optimization problem. Geometric characterization of global sensitivity spaces through their dimensions and relative positions by the principal angles between global search subspaces bring a first set of information on the impact of uncertainties on the functioning parameters on the optimal solution. Joining the multi-point descent direction and the quantiles on the optimization parameters permits to define the notion of Directional Extreme Scenarios (DES) without sampling of large dimension design spaces. One goes beyond DES with Ensemble Kalman Filters (EnKF) after the multi-point optimization algorithm is cast into an ensemble simulation environment. This formulation accounts for the variability in large dimension. The UQ cascade ends with the joint application of the EnKF and DES leading to the concept of Ensemble Directional Extreme Scenarios (EDES) which provides more exhaustive possible extreme scenarios knowing the Probability Density Function of our optimization parameters. A final interest of the approach is that it provides an indication of the size of the ensemble which must be considered in the EnKF. These ingredients are illustrated on an history matching problem., (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Randomness of material initial condition and uncertainties in the manufacturing process lead to variability in the microstructure, which in turn leads to variability in the macrolevel properties of the material. In this paper, D dual-phase polycrystalline microstructure is simulated based on the initial condition of the grain cores and the manufacturing environment, instead of Voronoi tessellation, which assumes equal grain growth velocities for different phases and therefore is unable to link variability in grain growth velocity to the manufacturing process variability. Then a homogenization method is applied to predict macrolevel properties. The cooling schedule of a dual -phase alloy is used to illustrate the methodology, and Young's modulus is the prediction quantity of interest. Even with a given cooling schedule, spatial variation of temperature affects the microstructure and properties; this variability is also incorporated in this paper through a random field representation. The uncertainty quantification methodology uses Gaussian process surrogate modeling for computational efficiency. The relative contributions of both aleatory and epistemic sources to the overall bulk property uncertainty are quantified using an innovative global sensitivity analysis approach; this provides guidance for manufacturing process control in order to meet the desired uncertainty bounds in the bulk property estimates.",,"Cai, GW|Mahadevan, S",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR MULTISCALE COMPUTATIONAL ENGINEERING,uncertainty quantification manufacturing process polycrystalline surrogate model random field multiscale modeling microstructure simulation,10.1615/IntJMultCompEng.2016015552

This part of a two-paper series presents a relatively detailed process-based model for nitrogen and phosphorus retention, cycling, and removal in flooded wetlands. The model captures salient features of nutrient dynamics and accounts for complex interactions among various physical, biogeochemical, and physiological processes. The model simulates oxygen dynamics and the impact of oxidizing and reducing conditions on nitrogen transformation and removal, and approximates phosphorus precipitation and releases into soluble forms under aerobic and anaerobic conditions, respectively. Nitrogen loss pathways of volatilization and denitrification are explicitly accounted for on a physical basis. Processes in surface water and the bottom-active soil layer are described by a system of coupled ordinary differential equations. A finite-difference numerical scheme is implemented to solve the coupled system of ordinary differential equations for various multiphase constituents' concentrations in the water column and wetland soil. The numerical solution algorithm is verified against analytical solutions obtained for simplified transport and fate scenarios. Quantitative global sensitivity analysis revealed consistent model performance with respect to critical parameters and dominant nutrient processes.

Two different methods of sensitivity analysis, RPART (Recursive Partitioning And Regression Trees) and GLM (General Linear Model) were applied in order to screen a subset of significant parameters. All the parameters which were found significant by at least one of these methods were entered as input to a GBM (Generalized Boosted Modeling) analysis in order to provide a quantitative measure of the sensitivity of the model variables to these parameters. Although the GBM is a general and powerful machine learning algorithm, it has substantial computational costs in both storage requirements and CPU time. Employing the screening stage reduces this cost. The results of the analysis highlighted the role of particulate organic material in the lake ecosystem and its impact on the over all lake nutrient budget The GBM analysis established, for example, that parameters such as particulate organic material diameter and density were particularly important to the model outcomes. The results were further explored by lumping together output variables that are associated with sub-components of the ecosystem. The variable lumping approach suggested that the phytoplankton group is most sensitive to parameters associated with the dominant phytoplankton group, dinoflagellates, and with nanoplankton (Chlorophyta), supporting the view of Lake Kinneret as a bottom-up system. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of such procedures for extracting useful information for model calibration and guiding further data collection. (C) ", Elsevier Ltd.

To do so, this paper analyzes alternative proportions of the total projects (m) that should be implemented (e.g., % and % of the total number of projects) as well as alternative standards (c) to be achieved, on average, for some indices (e.g., % and % of the average standard values, which represent the mean value of these indices for all projects). The overall analytical results are presented for both linearly and exponentially weighted constraints, using partial derivatives to perform local sensitivity analyses (i.e., for each selected or rejected project), and the results account for the effects of w, c, and m. Next, level curves are prepared over the whole domain for w to produce two-dimensional graphs that support a global sensitivity analysis (i.e., for all selected and rejected projects) and to account for the effects of w, c, and m for both linearly and exponentially weighted constraints. Application of this approach to the Iraqi national irrigation system as a case study showed that the results are less robust if a smaller proportion (%) of the total projects is chosen, with a change of up to % in the projects selected. In this context, an increase in the smallest weights for sustainability criteria also affected project choices. If the average standard to be achieved is made stricter (% of the average standard), the results become more robust, with a change of less than % in the selected projects. In this context, increases in the smallest weights for sustainability criteria did not affect the project choices.

In this paper we apply global sensitivity analysis to explore how influential the choice of spatial resolution is when compared to uncertainties in the Manning's friction coefficient parameters, the inflow hydrograph, and those stemming from the coarsening of topographic data used to produce Digital Elevation Models (DEMs). We apply the hydraulic model LISFLOOD-FP to produce several temporally and spatially variable model outputs that represent different aspects of flood inundation processes, including flood extent, water depth, and time of inundation. We find that the most influential input factor for flood extent predictions changes during the flood event, starting with the inflow hydrograph during the rising limb before switching to the channel friction parameter during peak flood inundation, and finally to the floodplain friction parameter during the drying phase of the flood event. Spatial resolution and uncertainty introduced by resampling topographic data to coarser resolutions are much more important for water depth predictions, which are also sensitive to different input factors spatially and temporally. Our findings indicate that the sensitivity of LISFLOOD-FP predictions is more complex than previously thought. Consequently, the input factors that modelers should prioritize will differ depending on the model output assessed, and the location and time of when and where this output is most relevant.",,"Savage, JTS|Pianosi, F|Bates, P|Freer, J|Wagener, T",WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,,10.1002/2015WR018198

Still, the adoption of density-based methods has been limited so far, possibly because they are relatively more difficult to implement. Here we present a novel GSA method, called PAWN, to efficiently compute density-based sensitivity indices. The key idea is to characterise output distributions by their Cumulative Distribution Functions (CDF), which are easier to derive than PDFs.

The mechanical behavior of the soil is modeled by an advanced elasto-plastic model, namely Hardening Soil model correlating small strain stiffness (HSS). Global sensitivity analysis is carried out in this paper to evaluate the relative sensitivity of model response to each input parameter. Thereafter, a parameter identification technique (back analysis) is employed to find the optimized values of the selected parameters. To accomplish this, the computationally expensive FE-model is replaced by a meta-model in order to reduce the calculation time and effort. Moreover, a soft soil constitutive model based on the modified Cam-clay model deals with primary compression of fine grained soils, is assigned to the clay layer to further improve the numerical prediction of system behavior. Due to the importance of model subsystems, such as face pressure and volume loss, the sensitivity of model response to subsystems has been evaluated.

The application of GSA is made possible for long-running flow simulators (computation (CPU) time more than several hours) by relying on meta-modeling techniques. However, such flow models can involve one or several spatial inputs, for instance, the permeability field of a reservoir and of a caprock formation in the context of CO geological storage. Studying the sensitivity to each of these spatial inputs motivated the present work. In this view, we propose a strategy which combines () a categorical indicator (i.e., a pointer variable taking discrete values) assigned to the set of stochastic realizations associated with each spatial input (spatial maps) and () meta-modeling techniques, which jointly handle continuous and categorical inputs. In a first application case, a costless-to-evaluate numerical multiphase flow model was used to estimate the sensitivity indices. Comparisons with results obtained using the meta-model showed good agreement using a two-to-three ratio of the number of learning samples to the number of spatial maps. On this basis, the strategy can be recommended for cases where the number of maps remains tractable (i.e., a few hundred), for example, for moderately complex geological settings, or where a set of such maps can be selected in a preliminary stage using ranking procedures. Finally, the strategy was applied to a more complex multiphase flow model (CPU time of a few hours) to analyze the sensitivity of CO saturation and injection-induced pressure build-up to seven homogeneous rock properties and two spatial inputs.",,"Rohmer, J",COMPUTATIONAL GEOSCIENCES,computationally intensive flow model sobol' indices surrogate model spatially dependent inputs pointer variables adaptive component selection and shrinkage operator,10.1007/s10596-013-9391-x

In the field of wastewater modelling, most of the recent applications of GSA use either regression-based methods, which require close to linear relationships between the model outputs and model factors, or screening methods, which only yield qualitative results. However, due to the characteristics of membrane bioreactors (MBR) (non-linear kinetics, complexity, etc.) there is an interest to adequately quantify the effects of non-linearity and interactions. This can be achieved with variance-based sensitivity analysis methods. In this paper, the Extended Fourier Amplitude Sensitivity Testing (Extended-FAST) method is applied to an integrated activated sludge model (ASMd) for an MBR system including microbial product formation and physical separation processes. Twenty-one model outputs located throughout the different sections of the bioreactor and  model factors are considered. Significant interactions among the model factors are found. Contrary to previous GSA studies for ASM models, we find the relationship between variables and factors to be non-linear and non-additive. By analysing the pattern of the variance decomposition along the plant, the model factors having the highest variance contributions were identified. This study demonstrates the usefulness of variance-based methods in membrane bioreactor modelling where, due to the presence of membranes and different operating conditions than those typically found in conventional activated sludge systems, several highly non-linear effects are present.

However, they often fail to find the optimum in case the objective function is multimodal, discrete or high-dimensional. It is also reported that most crossover (or recombination) operators for RCEAs has sampling bias that prevents to find the optimum near the boundary of search space. They like to search the center of search space much more than the other. Therefore, they will not work on functions that have their optima near the boundary of search space. In this paper, we apply two methods, genetic algorithm with search area adaptation (GSA) and toroidal search space conversion (TSC), to the function optimization for improving the robustness of RCEAs.

The approach is illustrated through a one-dimensional example involving the process of quartz cementation in sandstones and the resulting effects on the dynamics of the vertical distribution of porosity, pressure, and temperature. The proposed theoretical framework and computational tools allow performing an efficient and accurate global sensitivity analysis (GSA) of the system states (i.e., porosity, temperature, pressure, and fluxes) in the presence of uncertain key mechanical and geochemical model parameters as well as boundary conditions. GSA is grounded on the use of the variance-based Sobol indices. These allow discriminating the relative weights of uncertain quantities on the global model variance and can be computed through the GPCE of the model response. Evaluation of the GPCE of the model response is performed through the implementation of a sparse grid approximation technique in the space of the selected uncertain quantities.

The values of the design inputs might have strong effects on the future characteristics of the plant under study. For this reason, there is a need to determine how both design inputs and outputs are linked and how they affect wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) designs. In this paper we assess ASPDG with a methodology based on Monte Carlo (MC) simulations and Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA). The novelty of this approach relies on working with design input and output ranges instead of single values, identifying the most influential design inputs on the different design outputs and improving the interpretation of the generated results with a set of visualization tools. The variation in these design inputs is attributed to epistemic uncertainty, natural variability as well as operator, owner and regulator decision ranges. Design outputs are calculated by sampling the previously defined input ranges and propagating this variation through the design guideline. Standard regression coefficients (SRC), cluster analysis (CA) and response surfaces (RS) are used to identify/interpret the design inputs that influence the variation on the design outputs the most. The illustrative case study uses the widely recognized Metcalf & Eddy guidelines and presents a didactic design example for an organic carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) removal pre-denitrifying activated sludge plant. Results show that the proposed GSA can satisfactorily decompose the variance of the design outputs (R- > .): aerobic (V-AER) and anoxic (V-ANOX) volume, air demand (Q(AIR)) and internal recycle flow rate (Q(INTR)). Response surfaces are proposed to facilitate the visualization of how, when and why the design outputs may change when the most influential design inputs are modified. Finally, it is demonstrated that the proposed method is useful for process engineers providing a regional instead of a local picture of a design problem. (C) ", Elsevier Ltd.

However, few studies have investigated the effect of experiment type (slug injection versus constant rate injection) on model parameter sensitivity and identifiability. We conducted slug injection and constant-rate experiments in a low-gradient, alluvial, headwater tundra stream in northern Alaska. Each experimental data set was simulated with the one-dimensional transport with inflow and storage (OTIS) model and analyzed with Monte Carlo-based techniques to investigate differences in global sensitivity and time-varying identifiability of the model parameters. We found that the longitudinal dispersion parameter exhibited relatively high sensitivity for the slug injection data, while the storage zone area parameter exhibited relatively high sensitivity for the constant rate injection data. The storage zone area and storage zone - main channel exchange rate parameters show heightened sensitivity during rising and tailing portions of the constant rate injection breakthrough curve, whereas for the slug injection data, increased identifiability for these parameters is only observed during the tailing portion of the breakthrough curve. Results demonstrate that selection of slug injection or constant rate experiment type impacts parameter sensitivity and time-varying identifiability and that experimental data can easily be analyzed to understand the relative information content associated with each parameter of a -D transient storage model.",,"Wlostowski, AN|Gooseff, MN|Wagener, T",WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,,10.1002/wrcr.20103

As a part of this effort, the efficacy of HDMR, which has primarily been used in the past as a model reduction tool, is also demonstrated for uncertainty analysis. The application chosen to highlight the accuracy of these new techniques is the steady state analysis of the groundwater flow in the Savannah River Site General Separations Area (GSA) using the subsurface Flow And Contaminant Transport (FACT) code. Uncertain inputs included three-dimensional hydraulic conductivity fields, and a two-dimensional recharge rate field.

Since the class of f-divergences supports a wide variety of divergence or distance measures, a plethora of f-sensitivity indices are possible, affording diverse choices to sensitivity analysis. Commonly used sensitivity indices or measures, such as mutual information, squared-loss mutual information, and Borgonovo's importance measure, are shown to be special cases of the proposed sensitivity index. New theoretical results, revealing fundamental properties of the f-sensitivity index and establishing important inequalities, are presented.

There is a longstanding literature in economics and game theory that considers how to attribute the value of a team effort to individual members of that team. The primary result, known as the Shapley value, is the unique method satisfying some intuitively necessary criteria. In this paper we find the Shapley value of individual variables when we take ""variance explained"" as their combined value. The result does not match either of the usual Sobol' indices.

One of the challenges for the emerging industry is the high level of uncertainty in supply amounts, market demands, market prices, and processing technologies. These uncertainties complicate the assessment of investment decisions. This paper presents a model for the optimal design of biomass supply chain networks under uncertainty. The uncertainties manifest themselves as a large number of stochastic model parameters that could impact the overall profitability and design. The supply chain network we study covers the Southeastern region of the United States and includes biomass supply locations and amounts, candidate sites and capacities for two kinds of fuel conversion processing, and the logistics of transportation from the locations of forestry resources to the conversion sites and then to the final markets. To reduce the design problem to a manageable size the impact of each uncertain parameter on the objective function is computed for each end of the parameter's range. The parameters that cause the most change in the profit over their range are then combined into scenarios that are used to find a design through a two stage mixed integer stochastic program. The first stage decisions are the capital investment decisions including the size and location of the processing plants. The second stage recourse decisions are the biomass and product flows in each scenario. The objective is the maximization of the expected profit over the different scenarios. The robustness and global sensitivity analysis of the nominal design (for a single nominal scenario) vs. the robust design (for multiple scenarios) are analyzed using Monte Carlo simulation over the hypercube formed from the parameter ranges.

In this paper, we propose an efficient integrated approach that integrates a qualitative screening method (the Morris method) with a quantitative analysis method based on the statistical emulator (variance-based method with the response surface method, named the RSMSobol' method) to reduce the computational burden of GSA for time-consuming models. Using the Huaihe River Basin of China as a case study, the proposed approach is used to analyze the parameter sensitivity of distributed time-variant gain model (DTVGM). First, the Morris screening method is used to qualitatively identify the parameter sensitivity. Subsequently, the statistical emulator using the multivariate adaptive regression spline (MARS) method is chosen as an appropriate surrogate model to quantify the sensitivity indices of the DTVGM.

To solve the research problem, first a heuristic algorithm is developed for generating feasible initial solutions; then a method for improving the resulted solutions is presented based on Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA). Finally, the proposed method is compared with Lingo on a set of  test problems. The comparison demonstrates that the proposed method outperforms Lingo in most cases and has less time complexity.

264,WOS:000391887100006,2016,A NOVEL GLOBAL METHOD FOR RELIABILITY ANALYSIS WITH KRIGING,POLYNOMIAL CHAOS,"In engineering applications, an important challenge of structural reliability analysis is to minimize the number of calls to the performance function, which is expensive to evaluate. In recent years, metamodels have been introduced to solve this problem and the methods combining the Kriging model and Monte Carlo simulation have widely gained attention, because they sample training points sequentially. Two essential issues should be considered in these kinds of methods: the selection of the next training point and the stopping criterion of the iteration. EGRA (efficient global reliability analysis) and AK-MCS (active learning reliability method combining Kriging and Monte Carlo simulation) are two representative approaches, whose strategy of sampling training points and stopping criterion are based on evaluations of each Monte Carlo sample under certain learning functions. However, these proposed learning functions are based on the individual performance of each Monte Carlo sample, causing the methods to focus more on the local optimization. As a result, the idea of globally solving the problem was proposed and applied to the GSAS method in . In this paper, a new global reliability analysis method is proposed. Unlike GSAS, a new learning function called the uncertainty reduction quantification function (UROF) is put forward. Specifically, a new random variable proposed in GSAS that helps simplify the statistical feature of Monte Carlo samples is inherited from GSAS, and a weighting function that establishes the connection between any point and the next training point is proposed. These two functions are combined to build UROF, which quantifies the uncertainty reduction of predicted failure probability after a new training point is added. Meanwhile, a novel stopping criterion is proposed by calculating a prediction of an upper bound of failure probability's relative error; the iteration stops when this prediction reaches a preset bound. In the end, a series of examples are performed, which indicates that both UROF and the novel stopping criterion can improve the efficiency of the method, more or less.",,"Zhao, ZG|Duan, XJ|Wang, ZM",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR UNCERTAINTY QUANTIFICATION,reliability analysis uncertainty quantification monte carlo simulation kriging meta model design of experiments,10.1615/Int.J.UncertaintyQuantification.2016017441

This paper presents a sensitivity and uncertainty analysis of a D depth-averaged water quality model applied to a shallow estuary. The model solves the mass transport equation for Escherichia Coli, including the effects of water temperature, salinity, solar radiation, turbulent diffusion and short wave dispersion. The sensitivity of the concentration of E. Coli in the estuary to input parameters and the different sources of uncertainty are studied using Global Sensitivity Analysis based on Monte Carlo simulation methods and sensitivity measures based on linear and non-linear regression analysis, in order to aid modellers in the calibration process and in the interpretation of model output. The extinction coefficient of light in water and the depth of the vertical layer over which the E. coli spread were found to be the most relevant parameters of the model. In the shallowest regions of the estuary errors in the bathymetry are also an important source of uncertainty on model output. Globally, the combination of these three parameters was found to be very effective for calibration purposes in the whole estuary. (C) ", Elsevier Ltd.

Based on its abundant data, uncontrolled leakage history and subsequent control by the facility operators, a modeling framework was developed for studying reservoir behavior, examining pressure and gas-inventory histories, as well as gas and brine leakage, and evaluating the sensitivity of that behavior to uncertainty about reservoir properties. A three-dimensional model capturing the bounding fault, layered geologic stratigraphy, and surface topography was calibrated by history data of reservoir pressure and gas inventory. The calibrated model predicted gas arrival at the ground surface that was consistent with the timing of observed gas bubbling into a creek. A global sensitivity analysis was performed to examine the parameters influencing fault leakage, and a geomechanical stability analysis was conducted to investigate the likelihood of fault reactivation. In general, it is shown that a discrete leakage pathway is required to explain the observed gas leakage and its subsequent operational control by reducing reservoir pressures. Specifically, the results indicate that fault leakage is a plausible explanation for the observed gas leakage.

To achieve this, northern peatland models are becoming increasingly complex and now include feedback processes between peat depth, decomposition, hydrology, and vegetation composition and productivity. Here we present results from a global sensitivity analysis performed to assess the behavior and parameter interaction of a peatland simulation model. A series of simulations of the Holocene Peat Model were performed with different parameter combinations in order to assess the role of parameter interactions on the simulated total carbon mass after  years of peatland development. The impact of parameter uncertainty on the simulation results is highlighted, as is the importance of multiple parameter interactions. The model sensitivity indicates that peat physical properties play an important role in peat accumulation; these parameters are poorly constrained by observations and should be a focus of future research. Furthermore, the results show that autogenic processes are able to produce a wide range of peatland development behaviors independently of any external environmental changes.

All of these states are searched for errors or desirable patterns. However, the drawback for many real and complex systems is the state space explosion in which model checking cannot generate all the possible states. In this situation, designers can use refutation to check refusing a property rather than proving it. In refutation, it is very important to handle the state space for finding errors efficiently. In this paper, we propose an efficient solution to implement refutation in complex systems modeled by graph transformation. Since meta-heuristic algorithms are efficient solutions for searching in the problems with very large state spaces, we use them to find errors (e.g., deadlocks) in systems which cannot be verified through existing model checking approaches due to the state space explosion. To do so, we employ a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm to consider only a subset of states (called population) in each step of the algorithm. To increase the accuracy, we propose a hybrid algorithm using PSO and Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA). The proposed approach is implemented in GROOVE, a toolset for designing and model checking graph transformation systems.

GSA is then employed to assist parameter estimates within a Maximum Likelihood framework. Finally, formal model identification criteria are employed to (a) rank the alternative models, and (b) associate each model with a posterior probability weight for the specific case study.

Critical to process-based model development is conducting sensitivity analysis to determine the input parameters and their interactions that contribute most to the variance of the model output. Global and relative sensitivity analyses were applied to a process-based model for predicting ammonia emissions from the surface of anaerobic lagoons for treating and storing manure. The objectives were to compare global sensitivity analysis (GSA) to relative (local) sensitivity analysis (RSA) on a process-based model for ammonia emissions. Based on the first-order coefficient, both GSA and RSA showed the model input parameters in order of importance in process model for ammonia emissions from lagoon surfaces were: (i) pH, (ii) lagoon liquid temperature, (iii) wind speed above the lagoon surface, and (iv) the concentration of ammoniacal nitrogen in the lagoon. The GSA revealed that interactions between model parameters accounted for over two-thirds of the model variance, a result that cannot be achieved using traditional RSA. Also, the GSA showed that parameter interactions involving liquid pH had more impact on the model output variance than the single parameters: (i) temperature, (ii) wind speed, or (iii) total ammoniacal nitrogen. This study demonstrates that GSA provides a more complete analysis of model input parameters and their interactions on the model output compared to RSA.

Since reliable assessment of higher-order statistical moments can be computationally demanding, we couple our GSA approach with a surrogate model, approximating the full model response at a reduced computational cost.

We demonstrate our approach through three test cases, including an analytical benchmark, a simplified scenario mimicking pumping in a coastal aquifer and a laboratory-scale conservative transport experiment. Our results allow ascertaining which parameters can impact some moments of the model output pdf while being uninfluential to others.

The second test case involves five alternative bucket-style hydrologic models with up to  parameters applied to a medium-sized catchment ( km()) in the Belgian Ardennes. Results show that in both examples, Sobol' and DELSA identify similar important and unimportant parameters, with DELSA enabling more detailed insight at much lower computational cost. For example, in the real-world problem the time delay in runoff is the most important parameter in all models, but DELSA shows that for about % of parameter sets it is not important at all and alternative mechanisms and parameters dominate. Moreover, the time delay was identified as important in regions producing poor model fits, whereas other parameters were identified as more important in regions of the parameter space producing better model fits. The ability to understand how parameter importance varies through parameter space is critical to inform decisions about, for example, additional data collection and model development. The ability to perform such analyses with modest computational requirements provides exciting opportunities to evaluate complicated models as well as many alternative models.",,"Rakovec, O|Hill, MC|Clark, MP|Weerts, AH|Teuling, AJ|Uijlenhoet, R",WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,parameter sensitivity analysis delsa sobol' fuse hydrology multimodel,10.1002/2013WR014063

In this model, more stock increases the demand and ultimately fetches more profit but at the same time, invites more damage bringing down the profit amount. Moreover, the classical inventory models normally assume the production process to be perfectly reliable with a fixed set-up cost. In practice, it is not so. In this paper, an inventory model for a damageable item is formulated following profit maximization principle. Here, the unit production cost depends on production rate and is derived from the particular production function under which it is being produced. Demand for the item is directly proportional to stock and inversely proportional to unit selling price. Also, the units are kept in heaped stock and hence, likely to be damaged due to it. Flexibility of the production process, which is not perfectly reliable, is introduced in the manufacturing system by the generalized cost function. The set-up cost, the reliability of the production process, production rate and the inventory amount are the decision variables. Due to highly nonlinearity of the average profit function (i.e., objective function), it is optimized using contractive mapping genetic algorithm (CMGA) for the global optimal solution. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the model and some useful comments/decisions are derived for a decision maker (DM). Results are obtained via greedy search algorithm (GSA) and simulated annealing (SA) also and compared with those obtained from CMGA. (c) ", Elsevier Ltd.

Variance-based global sensitivity analysis has gained popularity because it can quantify the relative contribution of uncertainty from different sources. However, its computational cost increases dramatically with the complexity of the considered model and the dimension of model parameters. In this study, we developed a new sensitivity analysis method that integrates the concept of variance-based method with a hierarchical uncertainty quantification framework. Different uncertain inputs are grouped and organized into a multilayer framework based on their characteristics and dependency relationships to reduce the dimensionality of the sensitivity analysis. A set of new sensitivity indices are defined for the grouped inputs using the variance decomposition method. Using this methodology, we identified the most important uncertainty source for a dynamic groundwater flow and solute transport model at the Department of Energy (DOE) Hanford site. The results indicate that boundary conditions and permeability field contribute the most uncertainty to the simulated head field and tracer plume, respectively. The relative contribution from each source varied spatially and temporally. By using a geostatistical approach to reduce the number of realizations needed for the sensitivity analysis, the computational cost of implementing the developed method was reduced to a practically manageable level. The developed sensitivity analysis method is generally applicable to a wide range of hydrologic and environmental problems that deal with high-dimensional spatially distributed input variables.",,"Dai, H|Chen, XY|Ye, M|Song, XH|Zachara, JM",WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,sensitivity analysis variance decomposition parametric uncertainty model uncertainty groundwater transport modeling geostatistics,10.1002/2016WR019756

In fact, testing effort allocation is also a difficult issue, and it directly affects the software release time when a reliability criteria has to be met. However, with an increasing number of parameters involved in these models, the uncertainty of parameters estimated from the failure data could greatly affect the decision. Hence, it is of importance to study the impact of these model parameters. In this paper, sensitivity of the software release time is investigated through various methods, including one-factor-at-a-time approach, design of experiments and global sensitivity analysis. It is shown that the results from the first two methods may not be accurate enough for the case of complex nonlinear model. Global sensitivity analysis performs better due to the consideration of the global parameter space. The limitations of different approaches are also discussed.

The proposed indices accurately describe the connotations of the contributions by the correlated input to the variance of output, and they can be viewed as the complement and correction of the interpretation about the contributions by the correlated inputs presented in ""Estimation of global sensitivity indices for models with dependent variables, Computer Physics Communications,  () -"". Both of them contain the independent contribution by an individual input. Taking the general form of quadratic polynomial as an illustration, the total correlated contribution and the independent contribution by an individual input are derived analytically, from which the components and their origins of both contributions of correlated input can be clarified without any ambiguity. In the special case that no square term is included in the quadratic polynomial model, the total correlated contribution by the input can be further decomposed into the variance contribution related to the correlation of the input with other inputs and the independent contribution by the input itself, and the total uncorrelated contribution can be further decomposed into the independent part by interaction between the input and others and the independent part by the input itself. Numerical examples are employed and their results demonstrate that the derived analytical expressions of the variance-based importance measure are correct, and the clarification of the correlated input contribution to model output by the analytical derivation is very important for expanding the theory and solutions of uncorrelated input to those of the correlated one.", Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V.

An expression of the demand impact factor (DIF) is first proposed for indicating the influence of nodal demand effect based on a Lagrangian nodal demand model and implemented in the developed evaluation framework. Parameter sensitivity analysis is then conducted to evaluate the relevance and importance of the DIF to transient modeling and analysis in WDS.

This method is demonstrated on two synthetic and one hydraulic example. It can be shown that an uncertainty analysis based on one-dimensional scatter plots and correlation analyses such as the Spearman Rank Correlation coefficient can lead to misinterpretations of any model results. The method which has been proposed in this paper is based on multiple regression trees (so called Random Forests). The splits at each node of the regression tree are sampled from a probability distribution. Several criteria are enforced at each level of splitting to ensure positive information gain and also to distinguish between behavioural and non-behavioural model representations. The latter distinction is applied in the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation (GLUE) and regional sensitivity analysis (RSA) framework to analyse model results and is used here to derive regression tree (model) structures. Two methods of sensitivity analysis are used: in the first method the total information gain achieved by each parameter is evaluated. In the second method parameters and parameter sets are permuted and an error rate computed. This error rate is compared to values without permutation. This latter method allows the evaluation of the sensitivity of parameter combinations and thus gives an insight into the structure of the response surface. The examples demonstrate the capability of this methodology and stress the importance of the application of sensitivity analysis. (C) , Elsevier Ltd.

The gravity search algorithm (GSA) is an evolutionary optimization algorithm based on the law of gravity and mass interactions. This paper explores the GSA's efficacy for solving benchmark functions, single reservoir, and four-reservoir operation optimization problems. The GSA's solutions are compared with those of the well-known genetic algorithm (GA) in three optimization problems. The results show that the GSA's results are closer to the optimal solutions than the GA's results in minimizing the benchmark functions. The average values of the objective function equal . and . with the GSA and GA, respectively, in solving the single-reservoir hydropower operation problem. The global solution equals . for this same problem. The GSA converged to .% of the global solution in its average-performing history, while the GA converged to % of the global solution of the four-reservoir problem. Requiring fewer parameters for algorithmic implementation and reaching the optimal solution in fewer number of functional evaluations are additional advantages of the GSA over the GA.

In this study, the fate of micropollutants of four different classes was simulated in a conventional activated sludge plant using a bioreactor micropollutant fate model coupled to a settler model. The latter was based on the Burger-Diehl model extended for the first time to include micropollutant fate processes. Calibration of model parameters was completed by matching modelling results with full-scale measurements (i.e. including aqueous and particulate phase concentrations of micropollutants) obtained from a -day sampling campaign. Modelling results showed that further biodegradation takes place in the sludge blanket of the settler for the highly biodegradable caffeine, underlining the need for a reactive settler model. The adopted Monte Carlo based calibration approach also provided an overview of the model's global sensitivity to the parameters. This analysis showed that for each micropollutant and according to the dominant fate process, a different set of one or more parameters had a significant impact on the model fit, justifying the selection of parameter subsets for model calibration. A dynamic local sensitivity analysis was also performed with the calibrated parameters.

However, this procedure remains time-consuming and a single simulation can request several hours. As a consequence, the influence of uncertain input parameters on the SAR cannot be analyzed using crude Monte Carlo simulation. The solution presented here to perform such an analysis is surrogate modeling. This paper proposes a novel approach to build such a surrogate model from a design of experiments. Considering a sparse representation of the polynomial chaos expansions using least-angle regression as a selection algorithm to retain the most influential polynomials, this paper proposes to use the selected polynomials as regression functions for the universal Kriging model. The leave-one-outcross validation is used to select the optimal number of polynomials in the deterministic part of the Kriging model. The proposed approach, called LARS-Kriging-PC modeling, is applied to three benchmark examples and then to a full-scale metamodeling problem involving the exposure of a numerical fetus model to a femtocell device. The performances of the LARS-Kriging-PC are compared to an ordinary Kriging model and to a classical sparse polynomial chaos expansion. The LARS-Kriging-PC appears to have better performances than the two other approaches. A significant accuracy improvement is observed compared to the ordinary Kriging or to the sparse polynomial chaos depending on the studied case. This approach seems to be an optimal solution between the two other classical approaches.

In this study we developed a fuzzy rule based model, which uses available farm management data as required inputs, for the environmental assessment of farming systems. We also tried to make an analysis on the efficiency of current mathematical parameters in the development of our fuzzy model. Finally, in a practical example we demonstrate the applicability of the developed model for improvement of environmental status of the cane farming in Iran. A Mamdani fuzzy inference model with two inference engines was developed to combine five basic input indexes, which were selected as indicators of farms environmental status based on the experts' interview and scientific knowledge. To validate the developed model, we inserted several cycles of analysis using graphical and global sensitivity methods on the model and compared the model outcomes with experts' viewpoints. Using these analysis methods, we also evaluated the effects of changes in operators, membership function shape and defuzzification methods, on the model outcomes and their sensitivities. In this study, fuzzy inference emerged as a suitable, uncomplicated and effective tool for development of environmental assessment models. Totally, performance of one parameter was highly influenced by other parameters. For the selection of one parameter its interaction with other parameters had to be considered.

Within this framework, Probabilistic Collocation Method (PCM) was then applied to a WARMF model of diazinon pollution to assess the modeling uncertainty. Based on PCM, a global sensitivity analysis method named PCM-VD (VD stands for variance decomposition) was also developed, which quantifies variance contribution of all uncertain parameters. The study results validated the applicability of PCM and PCM-VD to the WARMF model. The PCM-based approach is much more efficient, regarding computational time, than conventional Monte Carlo methods. It has also been demonstrated that analysis using the PCM-based approach could provide insights into data collection, model structure improvement and management practices.

Uncertainty ranges are established for input parameters (e.g. chemical rate constants, Henry's law constants, etc.) and are used in conjunction with Latin hypercube sampling and multiple linear regression to conduct a sensitivity analysis which determines the correlation between each input parameter and the model Output. The contribution of each input parameter to the uncertainty in the model Output is calculated by combining the results of the sensitivity analysis with the input parameters' uncertainty ranges.

In the last decades, many artificial intelligence-based optimization methods have been used to solve ORPD problem. But, these optimization methods lack an effective means to handle constraints on state variables. Thus, in this paper, the novel and feasible conditional selection strategies (CSS) are devised to handle constraints efficiently in the proposed improved gravitational search algorithm (GSA-CSS). In addition, considering the weakness of GSA itself, the improved GSA-CSS (IGSA-CSS) is presented which employs the memory property of particle swarm optimization (PSO) to enhance global searching ability and utilizes the concept of opposition based learning (OBL) for optimizing initial population. The presented GSA-CSS and IGSA-CSS methods are applied to ORPD problem on IEEE-bus, IEEE-bus and IEEE-bus test systems for minimization of power transmission losses (P-loss) and voltage deviation (V-d), respectively.

Such predictions, therefore, must be accompanied by quantification of predictive uncertainty, especially when they are used for environmental risk assessment. We quantify the impact of parametric uncertainty on quantitative forecasting of temporal evolution of two key risk indices, volumes of unsaturated and saturated soil contaminated by a surface spill of light nonaqueous-phase liquids. This is accomplished by treating the relevant uncertain parameters as random variables and deploying two alternative probabilistic models to estimate their effect on predictive uncertainty. A physics-based model is solved with a stochastic collocation method and is supplemented by a global sensitivity analysis. A second model represents the quantities of interest as polynomials of random inputs and has a virtually negligible computational cost, which enables one to explore any number of risk-related contamination scenarios. For a typical oil-spill scenario, our method can be used to identify key flow and transport parameters affecting the risk indices, to elucidate texture-dependent behavior of different soils, and to evaluate, with a degree of confidence specified by the decision-maker, the extent of contamination and the correspondent remediation costs.",,"Ciriello, V|Lauriola, I|Bonvicini, S|Cozzani, V|Di Federico, V|Tartakovsky, DM",WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,risk analysis polynomial chaos groundwater site contamination lnapl,10.1002/2017WR021368

Parameters in a chemical mechanism have uncertainties, leading to the uncertainties of model predictions. A recently developed global sensitivity analysis (SA) method based on Random Sampling-High Dimensional Model Representation (RS-HDMR) was applied to the Regional Atmospheric Chemical Mechanism (RACM) within a zero-dimensional photochemical model to highlight the main uncertainty sources of atmospheric hydroxyl (OH) and hydroperoxyl (HO) radicals. This global SA approach can be applied as a routine in zero-dimensional photochemical modeling to comprehensively assess model uncertainty and sensitivity under different conditions. It also highlights the parameters to which the model is most sensitive during periods when the model/measurement OH and HO discrepancies are greatest. Uncertainties in  model parameters were assigned for measured constituents used to constrain the model, for photolysis and kinetic rate coefficients, and for product yields of the reactions. With simulations performed for the hourly field data of two typical days, modeled and measured OH and HO generally agree better for polluted conditions than for cleaner conditions, except during morning rush hour. Sensitivity analysis shows that the modeled OH and HO depend most critically on the reactions of xylenes and isoprene with OH, NO with OH, NO with HO, and internal alkenes with O- and suggests that model/measurement discrepancies in OH and HO would benefit from a closer examination of these reactions.",,"Chen, S|Brune, WH|Oluwole, OO|Kolb, CE|Bacon, F|Li, GY|Rabitz, H",ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY,,10.1021/es301565w

The contribution of each input parameter to the uncertainty in the model output is calculated by combining results of the sensitivity analysis with input parameters' uncertainty ranges.

Parameter subsets suitable for the Burger-Diehl model calibration are identified. For example, under the wet-weather condition, all model parameters, except f(n) and D-c,D-, are influential to SST performance. When filamentous bulking occurs, the outputs of the Burger-Diehl model are most sensitive to the hindered settling parameters, v() and r(h). In terms of parameter interactions, strong interactions are found among parameters in predicting C-e. However, for C-u, SI and Flux(op) under the bulking condition, the Burger-Diehl model is almost additive with negligible parameter interactions. Moreover, the sensitivity of the Burger-Diehl model outputs to parameters is highly impacted by the imposed simulation conditions, thus resulting in different parameter subsets for model calibration. For example, under the wet-weather condition, the compression settling parameters can be as important as the hindered settling parameters, while bulking of the sludge greatly increases the influence of the hindered settling parameters (v() and r(h)), and decreases the influence of the compression settling parameters. In terms of model reduction, reliable reduction of the Burger-Diehl model can be achieved based on GSA results. For example, under the bulking condition, the Burger-Diehl model can be reduced to the hindered-dispersion model regardless to model outputs. The reliability of the Burger-Diehl model reduction can be evaluated based on uncertainty, and unreliable reduction can negatively impact the decision making in SST design and control.", (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

It is based on an error-controlled solution of the partial differential equation (PDE) that describes the evolution of the probability density function associated with the input uncertainty/variability. The density yields a more accurate estimate of the output uncertainty/variability, where not only some observables (such as mean and variance) but also structural properties (e.g., skewness, heavy tails, bi-modality) can be resolved up to a selected accuracy. For the adaptive solution of the PDE Cauchy problem we use the Rothe method with multiplicative error correction, which was originally developed for the solution of parabolic PDEs. We show that, unlike in parabolic problems, conservation properties necessitate a coupling of temporal and spatial accuracy to avoid accumulation of spatial approximation errors over time. We provide convergence conditions for the numerical scheme and suggest an implementation using approximate approximations for spatial discretization to efficiently resolve the coupling of temporal and spatial accuracy. The performance of the method is studied by means of low-dimensional case studies. The favorable properties of the spatial discretization technique suggest that this may be the starting point for an error-controlled sensitivity analysis in higher dimensions.", (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

In the proposed model the effects of memory length of different karst flow systems of base-flow, intermediate-flow, and quick-flow and also time variation of recharge area (RA) during a hydrological year were investigated. The model consists of three sub-models: soil moisture balance (SMB), epikarst balance (EPB), and groundwater balance (GWB) to simulate the daily spring discharge. The SMB and EPB sub-models utilize the mass conservation equation to compute the variation of moisturestorages in the soil cover and epikarst, respectively. The GWB sub-model computes the spring discharge hydrograph through three parallel linear reservoirs for base-flow, intermediate -flow, and quick -flow. Three antecedent recharge indices are defined and embedded in the model structure to deal with the memory effect of three karst flow systems to antecedent recharge flow. The Sasan Karst aquifer located in the semi-arid region of south-west Iran with a continuous long-term (-years) daily meteorological and discharge data are considered to describe model calibration and validation procedures. The effects of temporal variations of RA of karst formations during the hydrological year namely invariant RA, two RA (winter and summer), four RA (seasonal), and twelve RA (monthly) are assessed to determine their impact on the model efficiency. Results indicated that the proposed model with monthly-variant RA is able to reproduce acceptable simulation results based on modified Kling-Gupta efficiency (KGE = -.). The results of density-based global sensitivity analysis for dry (June to September) and a wet (October to May) period reveal the dominant influence of RA (with sensitivity indices equal to . and ., respectively) in spring discharge simulation. The sensitivity of simulated spring discharge to memory effect of different karst formations during the dry period is greater than the wet period. In addition, the results reveal the important role of intermediate -flow system in the hydrological modeling of karst systems during the wet period. Precise estimation of groundwater budgets for a better decision making regarding water supplies from complex karst systems with long memory effect can considerably be improved by use of the proposed model.", (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Variance-based sensitivity analysis methods, which apportion each fraction of the output uncertainty (variance) to the effects of individual input parameters or their interactions, are considered the gold standard. The variance portions are called the Sobol sensitivity indices and can be estimated by a Monte Carlo (MC) approach (e.g., Saltelli's method []) or by employing a metamodel (e.g., the (generalized) polynomial chaos expansion (gPCE) [, ]). All these methods require a large number of model evaluations when estimating the Sobol sensitivity indices for models with many parameters []. To reduce the computational cost, we introduce a two-step approach. In the first step, a subset of important parameters is identified for each output of interest using the screening method of Morris []. In the second step, a quantitative variance-based sensitivity analysis is performed using gPCE. Efficient sampling strategies are introduced to minimize the number of model runs required to obtain the sensitivity indices for models considering multiple outputs. The approach is tested using a model that was developed for predicting post-operative flows after creation of a vascular access for renal failure patients. We compare the sensitivity indices obtained with the novel two-step approach with those obtained from a reference analysis that applies Saltelli's MC method. The two-step approach was found to yield accurate estimates of the sensitivity indices at two orders of magnitude lower computational cost."," Copyright (c) 2015John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Donders, WP|Huberts, W|van de Vosse, FN|Delhaas, T",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUMERICAL METHODS IN BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING,sensitivity analysis polynomial chaos expansion uncertainty quantification model personalization,10.1002/cnm.2727

Approaches such as efficient global reliability analysis (EGRA) and adaptive Kriging Monte Carlo simulation (AK-MCS) methods have been developed to adaptively select training points that are close to the limit state. Both the learning functions and convergence criteria of selecting training points in EGRA and AK-MCS are defined from the perspective of individual responses at Monte Carlo samples. This causes two problems: () some extra training points are selected after the reliability estimate already satisfies the accuracy target; and () the selected training points may not be the optimal ones for reliability analysis. This paper proposes a Global Sensitivity Analysis enhanced Surrogate (GSAS) modeling method for reliability analysis. Both the convergence criterion and strategy of selecting new training points are defined from the perspective of reliability estimate instead of individual responses of MCS samples. The new training points are identified according to their contribution to the uncertainty in the reliability estimate based on global sensitivity analysis. The selection of new training points stops when the accuracy of the reliability estimate reaches a specific target. Five examples are used to assess the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method.

Due to the intimate connection between the PDD and the Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) approaches, PDD is able to provide a simpler and more direct evaluation of the Sobol' sensitivity indices, when compared to the Polynomial Chaos expansion (PC). Unfortunately, the number of PDD terms grows exponentially with respect to the size of the input random vector, which makes the computational cost of standard methods unaffordable for real engineering applications. In order to address the problem of the curse of dimensionality, this work proposes essentially variance-based adaptive strategies aiming to build a cheap metamodel (i.e. surrogate model) by employing the sparse PDD approach with its coefficients computed by regression. Three levels of adaptivity are carried out in this paper: ) the truncated dimensionality for ANOVA component functions, ) the active dimension technique especially for second- and higher-order parameter interactions, and ) the stepwise regression approach designed to retain only the most influential polynomials in the PDD expansion. During this adaptive procedure featuring stepwise regressions, the surrogate model representation keeps containing few terms, so that the cost to resolve repeatedly the linear systems of the least-squares regression problem is negligible. The size of the finally obtained sparse PDD representation is much smaller than the one of the full expansion, since only significant terms are eventually retained. Consequently, a much smaller number of calls to the deterministic model is required to compute the final PDD coefficients.", (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

A Global Sensitivity Analysis is used to estimate their impact on water conditions in an important wetland area. The River Narew is modelled using a -D flow routing model. The Upper Narew Basin is situated in north-east Poland. A relatively large lowland reservoir, Siemianowka, constructed at the beginning of the s, is situated upstream. The river reach studied is  km long with a valuable wetland ecosystem, enclosed within the Narew National Park (NNP), at the downstream end. Previous management plans for the reservoir were focused on direct economic goals, such as energy production, fisheries and land irrigation. However, because of the rapid degradation of the NNP ecosystem observed in recent times, it was decided to include the protection of wetland areas as one of the reservoir's main goals. To achieve this, the current influence of its release policy on flow conditions is investigated. In addition, this investigation is performed jointly with an analysis of other factors, such as land use changes. Water management activities were represented by the controls having impact on measures, representing the water conditions at the NNP. Their significance was measured using Global Sensitivity Analysis. This allowed each inference/impact in the form of sensitivity indexes to be quantified and compared. Additionally, in the case of spatially distributed (diffuse) impacts, it was possible to estimate their significance for the hydrology and ecology of wetland area situated along the river reach. The results showed that the floodplain land use has a significant local effect on the water levels and the related extent of flood inundation.

To help develop Such a computational capability, we employ a multiple-surrogate model-based approach to aid in the model validation and calibration process of a transport-based, homogeneous cryogenic cavitation model. We assess the role of empirical parameters in the cavitation model and uncertainties in material properties via global sensitivity analysis coupled with multiple surrogates including polynomial response surface, radial basis neural network, kriging, and a predicted residual sum of squares-based weighted average surrogate model. The global sensitivity analysis results indicate that the performance of cavitation model is more sensitive to the changes in model parameters than to uncertainties in material properties. Although the impact of uncertainty in temperature-dependent vapor pressure on the predictions seems significant, uncertainty in latent heat influences only temperature field. The influence of wall heat transfer on pressure load is insignificant. We find that slower onset of vapor condensation leads to deviation of the predictions front the experiments. The recalibrated model parameters rectify the importance of evaporation source terms, resulting in significant improvements in pressure predictions. The model parameters need to be adjusted for different fluids, but for a given fluid, they help capture the essential fluid physics with different geometry and operating conditions."," Copyright (C) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Goel, T|Thakur, S|Haftka, RT|Shyy, W|Zhao, JH",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUMERICAL METHODS IN FLUIDS,cavitation code validation cryogenics multiple surrogates global sensitivity analysis,10.1002/fld.1779

The model evaluation technique practiced today in hydrology assumes that model parameters are season insensitive and attempts to identify ""optimal"" values that would describe watershed behavior during dry and wet seasons. This assumption could compromise accuracy of model predictions. This study demonstrates performance improvement that would be achieved when a season-based model evaluation approach is pursued. A global sensitivity analysis (SA) model has been used to investigate seasonal sensitivity of streamflow parameters of a watershed simulation model on the headwaters of the Little River Watershed, one of the United States Department of Agriculture's experimental watersheds. Two separate analyses have been performed: the conventional approach in which model parameters are assumed to be season insensitive; and a season-based evaluation in which the influential parameters may vary for months with a low runoff coefficient and months with a high runoff coefficient. The sensitivity analysis helped to identify dominant model and watershed behaviors for the conventional annual approach and for the wet and dry seasons. The SA results show that the influential parameters exhibited modest seasonal sensitivity for the experimental watershed. Model calibration was then performed by using the dynamically dimensioned search (DDS) algorithm for the conventional and season-based approaches using the principal parameters identified by the global SA model. Performance of the calibration attempts have been verified with the traditional split-sampling technique and also by assessing effectiveness of the model in predicting internal watershed behaviors through comparison of simulated streamflow with observations at multiple internal sites not used for calibration. Several efficiency measures have been used to test goodness of the model simulations. The season-based model evaluation technique showed superior performance compared with the traditional method of assuming constant model parameters across seasons. The watershed simulation model exhibited reasonable accuracy in simulating streamflow at the internal sites and for the verification periods when parameter values are allowed to vary from dry to wet season. The ""optimal"" parameter values identified by the calibration attempts showed significant seasonal sensitivity.

The Yichun River Basin, China, is used as a case study, and the sensitivity of the SWAT parameters is analyzed under typical dry, normal and wet years, respectively. To reduce the number of model parameters, some spatial model parameters are grouped in terms of data availability and multipliers are then applied to parameter groups, reflecting spatial variation in the distributed SWAT model. The SWAT model performance is represented using two statistical metrics - Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) and two hydrological metrics - RunOff Coefficient Error (ROCE) and Slope of the Flow Duration Curve Error (SFDCE). The analysis reveals the individual effects of each parameter and its interactions with other parameters. Parameter interactions contribute to a significant portion of the variation in all metrics considered under moderate and wet years. In particular, the variation in the two hydrological metrics is dominated by the interactions, illustrating the necessity of choosing a global sensitivity analysis method that is able to consider interactions in the SWAT model identification process. In the dry year, however, the individual effects control the variation in the other three metrics except SFDCE. Further, the two statistical metrics fail to identify the SWAT parameters that control the flashiness (i.e., variability of mid-flows) and overall water balance.

Indeed, by means of global sensitivity analysis (GSA), modellers may identify both important (factor prioritisation) and non-influential (factor fixing) model factors. No general rule has yet been defined for verifying the convergence of the GSA methods. In order to fill this gap this paper presents a convergence analysis of three widely used GSA methods (SRC, Extended FAST and Morris screening) for an urban drainage stormwater quality-quantity model. After the convergence was achieved the results of each method were compared. In particular, a discussion on peculiarities, applicability, and reliability of the three methods is presented. Moreover, a graphical Venn diagram based classification scheme and a precise terminology for better identifying important, interacting and non-influential factors for each method is proposed. In terms of convergence, it was shown that sensitivity indices related to factors of the quantity model achieve convergence faster. Results for the Morris screening method deviated considerably from the other methods. Factors related to the quality model require a much higher number of simulations than the number suggested in literature for achieving convergence with this method. In fact, the results have shown that the term ""screening"" is improperly used as the method may exclude important factors from further analysis. Moreover, for the presented application the convergence analysis shows more stable sensitivity coefficients for the Extended-FAST method compared to SRC and Morris screening. Substantial agreement in terms of factor fixing was found between the Morris screening and Extended FAST methods. In general, the water quality related factors exhibited more important interactions than factors related to water quantity. Furthermore, in contrast to water quantity model outputs, water quality model outputs were found to be characterised by high non-linearity.", (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

If the modeling results are used to inform resource-management decisions, then providing robust estimates of uncertainty in the simulated response is an important consideration. Here we examine the importance of parameterization, a necessarily subjective process, on uncertainty estimates of the simulated hydrologic response of land-cover change. Specifically, we applied the soil water assessment tool (SWAT) model to a . km() watershed in southern Texas to investigate the simulated hydrologic response of brush management (the mechanical removal of woody plants), a discrete land-cover change. The watershed was instrumented before and after brush-management activities were undertaken, and estimates of precipitation, streamflow, and evapotranspiration (ET) are available; these data were used to condition and verify the model. The role of parameterization in brush-management simulation was evaluated by constructing two models, one with  adjustable parameters (reduced parameterization) and one with  adjustable parameters (full parameterization). Both models were subjected to global sensitivity analysis as well as Monte Carlo and generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation (GLUE) conditioning to identify important model inputs and to estimate uncertainty in several quantities of interest related to brush management. Many realizations from both parameterizations were identified as ""behavioral"" in that they reproduce daily mean streamflow acceptably well according to Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient, percent bias, and coefficient of determination. However, the total volumetric ET difference resulting from simulated brush management remains highly uncertain after conditioning to daily mean streamflow, indicating that streamflow data alone are not sufficient to inform the model inputs that influence the simulated outcomes of brush management the most. Additionally, the reduced-parameterization model grossly underestimates uncertainty in the total volumetric ET difference compared to the full-parameterization model; total volumetric ET difference is a primary metric for evaluating the outcomes of brush management. The failure of the reduced-parameterization model to provide robust uncertainty estimates demonstrates the importance of parameterization when attempting to quantify uncertainty in land-cover change simulations.",,"White, J|Stengel, V|Rendon, S|Banta, J",HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES,,10.5194/hess-21-3975-2017

The anaerobic digestion model no.  implemented in the plant-wide context provided by the benchmark simulation model no.  is used to quantify the generation of CH, H- and CO. A comprehensive global sensitivity analysis based on (i) standardized regression coefficients (SRC) and (ii) Morris' screening's (MS's) elementary effects reveals the set of parameters that influence the biogas production uncertainty the most. This analysis is repeated for (i) different temperature regimes and (ii) different solids retention times (SRTs) in the anaerobic digester. Results show that both SRC and MS are good measures of sensitivity unless the anaerobic digester is operating at low SRT and mesophilic conditions. In the latter situation, and due to the intrinsic nonlinearities of the system, SRC fails in decomposing the variance of the model predictions (R- < .) making MS a more reliable method. At high SRT, influent fractionations are the most influential parameters for predictions of CH and CO emissions. Nevertheless, when the anaerobic digester volume is decreased (for the same load), the role of acetate degraders gains more importance under mesophilic conditions, while lipids and fatty acid metabolism is more influential under thermophilic conditions.

For lower limb multi-body models, sensitivity analyses have been mainly performed on musculoskeletal parameters, more rarely on the parameters of the joint models. This study deals with a global sensitivity analysis achieved on a lower limb multi-body model that introduces anatomical constraints at the ankle, tibiofemoral, and patellofemoral joints. The aim of the study was to take into account the uncertainty of parameters (e.g. . cm on the positions of the skin markers embedded in the segments, A degrees on the orientation of hinge axis, . mm on the origin and insertion of ligaments) using statistical distributions and propagate it through a multi-body optimisation method used for the computation of joint kinematics from skin markers during gait. This will allow us to identify the most influential parameters on the minimum of the objective function of the multi-body optimisation (i.e. the sum of the squared distances between measured and model-determined skin marker positions) and on the joint angles and displacements. To quantify this influence, a Fourier-based algorithm of global sensitivity analysis coupled with a Latin hypercube sampling is used. This sensitivity analysis shows that some parameters of the motor constraints, that is to say the distances between measured and model-determined skin marker positions, and the kinematic constraints are highly influencing the joint kinematics obtained from the lower limb multi-body model, for example, positions of the skin markers embedded in the shank and pelvis, parameters of the patellofemoral hinge axis, and parameters of the ankle and tibiofemoral ligaments. The resulting standard deviations on the joint angles and displacements reach A degrees and  mm.

Sobol's method is used to screen insensitive decision variables and guide the formulation of reduced complexity WDS optimization problems (i.e., fewer decision variables). This sensitivity-informed problem decomposition dramatically reduces the computational demands associated with attaining high-quality approximations for optimal WDS trade-offs. This study demonstrates that the results for the reduced-complexity WDS problems can then be used to precondition and significantly enhance full search of the original WDS problem. Two case studies of increasing complexity-the New York Tunnels network and the Anytown network-are used to demonstrate the proposed methodology. In both cases, sensitivity analysis results reveal that WDS performance is strongly controlled by a small proportion of decision variables, which should be the focus of preconditioning problem formulations. Sensitivity-informed problem decomposition and preconditioning are evaluated rigorously for their ability to improve the efficiency, reliability, and effectiveness of multiobjective evolutionary optimization. Overall, this study reveals for the first time that the use of global sensitivity analysis is computationally efficient and potentially critical when solving the complex multiobjective WDS problems.

GSA is an essential component of model building as it helps to identify model inputs that account for most of the model output variance. However, this approach is seldom applied to spatial models because it cannot describe how uncertainty propagation interacts with another key issue in spatial modeling: the issue of model upscaling, that is, a change of spatial support of model output. In many environmental models, the end user is interested in the spatial average or the sum of the model output over a given spatial unit (for example, the average porosity of a geological block). Under a change of spatial support, the relative contribution of uncertain model inputs to the variance of aggregated model output may change. We propose a simple formalism to discuss this issue within a GSA framework by defining point and block sensitivity indices. We show that the relative contribution of an uncertain spatially distributed model input increases with its correlation length and decreases with the size of the spatial unit considered for model output aggregation.

However, it tends to suffer from premature convergence and loses the abilities of exploration and exploitation when solving complex problems.

The chaotic operator can enhance its global convergence to escape from local optima, and the memory strategy provides a faster convergence and shares individual's best fitness history to improve the exploitation ability. After that, convergence analysis of the proposed IGSA is presented based on discrete-time linear system theory and results show that IGSA is not only guaranteed to converge under the conditions, but can converge to the global optima with the probability .

The hypothetical CO geological sequestration system is composed of three subsystems: a deep storage reservoir, a fault in caprock, and a shallow aquifer, which are modeled respectively by considering sub-domain-specific physics. Supercritical CO is injected into the reservoir subsystem with uncertain permeabilities of reservoir, caprock, and aquifer, uncertain fault location, and injection rate (as a decision variable). The simulated pressure and CO/brine saturation are connected to the fault-leakage model as a boundary condition. CO and brine fluxes from the fault-leakage model at the fault outlet are then imposed in the aquifer model as a source term. Uncertainties are propagated from the deep reservoir model, to the fault-leakage model, and eventually to the geochemical model in the shallow aquifer, thus contributing to risk profiles. To quantify the uncertainties and assess leakage-relevant risk, we propose a global sampling-based method to allocate sub-dimensions of uncertain parameters to sub-models. The risk profiles are defined and related to CO plume development for pH value and total dissolved solids (TDS) below the EPA's Maximum Contaminant Levels (MCL) for drinking water quality. A global sensitivity analysis is conducted to select the most sensitive parameters to the risk profiles. The uncertainty of pH- and TDS-defined aquifer volume, which is impacted by CO and brine leakage, mainly results from the uncertainty of fault permeability. Subsequently, high-resolution, reduced-order models of risk profiles are developed as functions of all the decision variables and uncertain parameters in all three subsystems. (C) ", Elsevier Ltd.

The study, which is performed with the Benchmark Simulation Model no.  plant design, complements a previous paper on input uncertainty characterisation and propagation (Sin et al., ). A sampling-based sensitivity analysis is conducted to compute standardized regression coefficients. It was found that this method is able to decompose satisfactorily the variance of plant performance criteria (with R() > .) for effluent concentrations, sludge production and energy demand. This high extent of linearity means that the plant performance criteria can be described as linear functions of the model inputs under the defined plant conditions. In effect, the system of coupled ordinary differential equations can be replaced by multivariate linear models, which can be used as surrogate models. The importance ranking based on the sensitivity measures demonstrates that the most influential factors involve ash content and influent inert particulate COD among others, largely responsible for the uncertainty in predicting sludge production and effluent ammonium concentration. While these results were in agreement with process knowledge, the added value is that the global sensitivity methods can quantify the contribution of the variance of significant parameters, e.g., ash content explains % of the variance in sludge production. Further the importance of formulating appropriate sensitivity analysis scenarios that match the purpose of the model application needs to be highlighted. Overall, the global sensitivity analysis proved a powerful tool for explaining and quantifying uncertainties as well as providing insight into devising useful ways for reducing uncertainties in the plant performance.

The model implementation in a Mediterranean semi-arid study site resulted satisfactorily (cell by cell calibration accuracy >= % and cell by cell validation accuracy between % and %), demonstrating the great potential of this approach for future research and management applications. Although  parameters are included in the model conceptualization, the global sensitivity analysis demonstrated that only eight types of parameters are actually influent.

The, highly dispersed transit time distributions often generated by these media are taken into consideration by simply stipulating that advection-dispersion transport occurs through both the porous and the biofilm phases. Both phases are coupled but assigned with contrasting hydrodynamic properties. However, the dual flowing continuum suffers from intrinsic equifinality in the sense that the outlet solute concentration can be the result of several parameter sets of the two flowing phases. To assess the applicability of the dual flowing continuum, we investigate how the model behaves with respect to its parameters. For the purpose of this study, a Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA) and a Statistical Calibration (SC) of model parameters are performed for two transport scenarios that differ by the strength of interaction between the flowing phases. The GSA is shown to be a valuable tool to understand how the complex system behaves. The results indicate that the rate of mass transfer between the two phases is a key parameter of the model behavior and influences the identifiability of the other parameters. For weak mass exchanges, the output concentration is mainly controlled by the velocity in the porous medium and by the porosity of both flowing phases. In the case of large mass exchanges, the kinetics of this exchange also controls the output concentration. The SC results show that transport with large mass exchange between the flowing phases is more likely affected by equifinality than transport with weak exchange. The SC also indicates that wealdy sensitive parameters, such as the dispersion in each phase, can be accurately identified. Removing them from calibration procedures is not recommended because it might result in biased estimations of the highly sensitive parameters.", (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Two notable properties, stemming from weakened annihilating conditions, reveal that the component functions of the generalized ADD have zero means and are hierarchically orthogonal. By exploiting these properties, a simple alternative approach is presented to derive a coupled system of equations that the generalized ADD component functions satisfy. The coupled equations, which subsume as a special case the classical ADD, reproduce the component functions for independent probability measures. To determine the component functions of the generalized ADD, a new constructive method is proposed by employing measure-consistent, multivariate orthogonal polynomials as bases and calculating the expansion coefficients involved from the solution of linear algebraic equations. New generalized formulae are presented for the second-moment characteristics, including triplets of global sensitivity indices, for dependent probability distributions. Furthermore, the generalized ADD leads to extended definitions of effective dimensions, reported in the current literature for the classical ADD. Numerical results demonstrate that the correlation structure of random variables can significantly alter the composition of component functions, producing widely varying global sensitivity indices and, therefore, distinct rankings of random variables.

Quantifying this uncertainty is very important for policy makers and stakeholders who rely on the output of these models for watershed management. Given the large number of parameters in these complex models, a preliminary sensitivity analysis is needed before the uncertainty analysis. A few sensitivity studies have been conducted for watershed models, but efficiently selecting critical parameters for the uncertainty analysis remains an issue. This study aimed to ( ) develop a framework for systematically conducting a preliminary sensitivity analysis for complex watershed models using generalized sensitivity analysis (GSA) as a global technique and ( ) evaluate the relevance of incorporating management concerns in the preliminary sensitivity analysis and its impact on parameter selection. Although the proposed approach is valid for any complex watershed model, for this study the Watershed Analysis Risk Management Framework (WARMF) model was implemented using data from the Santa Clara River in southern California. To simulate hydrology, sediment, and pesticide transport,  parameters are needed for a single catchment/ reach combination; an efficient selection method is paramount for an uncertainty analysis. The results show that GSA can be implemented efficiently, yielding insights into model and parameter behavior. The sensitivity analysis must consider management concerns early on in the process to identify parameters and parameter values that can influence management decisions. The number of parameters that must be considered in a subsequent uncertainty analysis was significantly reduced.

The utility of a model is enhanced by the application of sensitivity analysis techniques (SA), which seek to quantify the relative importance of different input variables. Among several SA methods available, global sensitivity analysis (GSA) provides a powerful means of ranking inputs based on the contribution that each makes towards the variance of a model. To demonstrate the value of the approach, this paper describes the application of GSA to a mathematical model of the synthetic adsorbent-based chromatographic capture of antibodies from ovine serum, a strategy being considered by Protherics UK Limited for production of an FDA-approved rattlesnake anti-venom. RESULTS: Results indicated that the binding capacity of the adsorbent for the antibody molecules was the most significant factor influencing their recovery, followed closely by the flowrate at which the ovine serum was applied to the column and then finally the antibody concentration in the feedstock. Together, these accounted for almost % of the model variance and hence suggest that these would be the key variables to focus upon during process development. CONCLUSION: Such data illustrate how GSA enables development studies to be concentrated upon those factors which exert the greatest influence on manufacturing performance. Ultimately, this reduces the size of the design space, making it easier to optimize a process and identify the most suitable operating conditions for large-scale drug production.", (c) 2007 Society of Chemical Industry.,"Chhatre, S|Francis, R|Newcombe, AR|Zhou, Y|Titchener-Hooker, N|King, J|Keshavarz-Moore, E",JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL TECHNOLOGY AND BIOTECHNOLOGY,antibody global sensitivity analysis model simulation throughput yield window of operation,10.1002/jctb.1801

These models require the specification of many surface properties which can generally be obtained from laboratory or field experiments, using time consuming techniques, or can be derived from textural information. The required accuracy of the surface properties depends on the model complexity and their misspecification can affect model performance. At various time and spatial resolutions, remote sensing provides information related to surface parameters in SVAT models or state variables simulated by SVAT models. In this context, the Simple Soil-Plant-Atmosphere Transfer-Remote Sensing (SiSPAT-RS) model was developed for remote sensing data assimilation objectives. This new version of the physically based SiSPAT model simulates the main surface processes (energy fluxes, soil water content profiles, temperatures) and remote sensing data in the visible, infrared and thermal infrared spectral domains. As a preliminary step before data assimilation in the model, the objectives of this study were () to apply a multiobjective approach for retrieving quantitative information about the surface properties from different surface measurements and () to determine the potential of the SiSPAT-RS model to be applied with 'little' a priori information about input parameters. To reach these goals, the ability of the Multiobjective Generalized Sensitivity Analysis (MOGSA) algorithm to determine and quantify the most influential input parameters of the SiSPAT-RS model on several simulated output variables, was investigated. The results revealed the main influential input parameters according to different contrasted environmental conditions, and contributed to the reduction of their a priori uncertainty range. A procedure for specifying surface properties from MOGSA results was tested on the thermal and hydraulic soil parameters, and evaluated through the SiSPAT-RS model performance.

These uncertainties are pervasive through the complex nature of the system, the long term consequences of decisions, and in the models and analytical approaches used. These greatly increase the challenges of informing robust decision making. Energy system studies have tended not to address uncertainty in a systematic manner, relying on simple scenario or sensitivity analysis. This paper utilises an innovative UK energy system model, ESME, which characterises multiple uncertainties via probability distributions and propagates these uncertainties to explore tradeoffs in cost effective energy transition scenarios. A linked global sensitivity analysis is used to explore the uncertainties that have most impact on the transition. The analysis highlights the strong impact of uncertainty on delivering the required emission reductions, and the need for an appropriate carbon price. Biomass availability, gas prices and nuclear capital costs emerge as critical uncertainties in delivering emission reductions.

The Gravitational search algorithm (GSA) is a recent created metaheuristic algorithm by using law of gravity and mass interactions. In this paper, a new operator inspired by some of the characteristics of the black hole as an astronomy phenomenon for GSA is presented. When a star is converted to a black hole under situations, it has the extremely strong gravity that prevents anything to escape from, and the objects that are closed to the black hole, experience very strong force called tidal force which it causes to collapse them to the black hole.

To improve the knowledge of structure-process interactions in initial ecosystems, the -ha artificial Chicken Creek Catchment in Germany was investigated by the Transregional Collaborative Research Centre  (SFB/TRR ). Sediment structures called pour-ribs, which are dumped by stackers during the construction process, lead to differently compacted sediment zones, which increase the spatial variability of sediments' hydraulic properties. Although levelled afterwards by bulldozers, the majority of these structures remain in the subsurface. To analyse the effects of pour-ribs on the hydrological catchment's behaviour, the process-based spatially distributed Water balance Simulation Model (WaSiM-ETH) was applied. The results show that the consideration of pour-ribs improves the runoff simulation and significantly affects the simulated soil moisture patterns and, thereby, the initial stage of the ecosystem development. Compacted zones act as hydraulic barriers and inhibit subsurface lateral water flow, whereas non-compacted zones constitute areas with increased water storage capacity. Both effects cause reduced catchment runoff. Moreover, disregarding of the pour-ribs was identified as a source of model uncertainty in previous studies. A further outcome of this study is the importance of a global sensitivity analysis as a tool for model improvement.

Physically, waves are strongly linked to the time-varying evolution of the relative cyclone position. Thus, even assuming the main cyclone characteristics to be stationary, exploring the role played by each of them should necessarily be conducted in a dynamic manner. This problem is investigated using the advanced statistical tools of variance-based global sensitivity analysis (VBSA) in different ways to provide an overall view of wave height sensitivity to cyclone characteristics: () step-by-step: by computing the time series of sensitivity measures; () aggregated: by summarising the time-varying information into a single sensitivity indicator; (). mode-based: by studying the sensitivity with respect to the occurrence of specific temporal patterns (e.g. up-down translation of the overall series). Yet, applying this multi-look dynamic sensitivity analysis faces two major difficulties: () VBSA requires a large number of simulations (typically > ,), which appears to be incompatible with the large computation time cost of numerical codes (> several hours for a single run); () integrating the time dimension imposes to process a large amount of information via vectors of large size (e.g. series of significant wave height H (S) discretised over several hundreds of time steps). In this study, we propose a joint procedure combining kriging meta-modelling (to overcome the st issue) and principal component analysis techniques (to overcome the nd issue by summarising the time information into a limited number of components). The applicability of this strategy is tested and demonstrated on a real case (Sainte-Suzanne city, located at Reunion Island) using a set of  cyclone-induced H (S) series, each of them being computed for different scenarios of cyclone characteristics, i.e. using only  long-running simulations. The key role of R (m) over the whole evolution of H (S) is shown by means of the aggregated option, with a more specific influence in the vicinity of Sainte-Suzanne (when the cyclone eye is located less than  km away from the site) as highlighted by the step-by-step option. The step-by-step option also highlights the influence of the landfall position on the H (S) peak reached in strong interaction with theta and R (m). Finally, the role of V (f) in the occurrence of a turning point marking a shift near landfall between regimes of low-to-high H (S) values is also identified.

A variety of approaches have been proposed for global sensitivity analysis, based on different philosophies and theories, and each of these formally characterizes a different ""intuitive'' understanding of sensitivity. These approaches focus on different properties of the model response at a fundamental level and may therefore lead to different (even conflicting) conclusions about the underlying sensitivities. Here we revisit the theoretical basis for sensitivity analysis, summarize and critically evaluate existing approaches in the literature, and demonstrate their flaws and shortcomings through conceptual examples. We also demonstrate the difficulty involved in interpreting ""global'' interaction effects, which may undermine the value of existing interpretive approaches.

Uncertainties were assigned for hundreds of model parameters including measurements used to constrain the model as well as kinetic rate coefficients and product yields of chemical reactions. Monte Carlo simulations were run using a zero-dimensional box model with  representative base cases of different initial conditions extracted from the measurements of a field campaign conducted in Houston, Texas. The results showed that relative uncertainty (+/-  sigma) of ozone production exhibits a pattern of higher uncertainty at morning rush hour (about -%) and lower uncertainty in the afternoon (about -%). The model uncertainty comes mostly from uncertainties in chemical schemes while the uncertainties in measurements are less influential. The most important model parameters are generally associated with the amounts of acetaldehyde, the photolysis of HONO and HCHO(-> HO), and the reactions of OH with NO, HO with NO, and xylenes with OH. The uncertainties in these parameters could also shift the ozone-precursor relation between the NOx-sensitive and VOC-sensitive regimes. The greater values of the NO amount and the reaction rates of NO + OH, NO + HO and ISOP (isoprene peroxy radicals) + NO increase VOC-sensitivity, while greater values of aldehydes amounts and kinetic rate coefficients for reactions of OH with aldehydes and xylenes and of ISOP with HO increase NOx-sensitivity of ozone under the studied conditions.

Sources of uncertainties assessed in this study stem from uncertainties in model parameterisation and from uncertainties in model input data (climate, soil data, and land management assumptions). Thereby, Monte Carlo based global sensitivity and uncertainty analysis using a latin hypercube stratified sampling technique was applied to derive plot scale (focusing on temporal propagation) and river basin scale propagation of uncertainty for long-term soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics. The model used is the eco-hydrological river basin model SWIM (Soil and Water Integrated Model), which has been extended by a process-based multi-compartment model for SOM turnover. Results obtained by this study can be transferred and used in other simulation models of this kind. Uncertainties resulting from all input factors used (model parameters + model input data) show a coefficient of variation between . and .% and accounted for +/- . to +/- .% soil carbon content (.-. t C ha(-) yr(-)). Parameter derived uncertainty contributed most to overall uncertainty. Concerning input data contributions, uncertainties stemming from soil and climate input data variations are striking. At the river basin scale, cropland and forest ecosystems, loess and gleyie soils possess the highest degree of uncertainty. Quantified magnitudes of uncertainty stemming from the examined sources vary temporally and spatially due to specific natural settings (e.g. climate, land use and soil properties) and deliver useful information for interpreting simulation results on long-term soil organic carbon dynamics under environmental change. Derived from this analysis, key sensitive model parameters and interactions between them were identified: the mineralization rate coefficient, the carbon use efficiency parameter (synthesis coefficient) along with parameters determining the soil temperature influence on SOM turnover (mainly Q  value) and the soil input related data (soil bulk density and initial soil C content) introduced the highest degree of model uncertainty. The here gained information can be transferred to other process-based SOM turnover models to consider stronger most crucial parameters introducing highest uncertainty contribution to soil C storage assessment under changing environmental conditions.

One of the fundamental information gaps concerns the sensitivity of coupled system feedbacks to various endogenous system properties and exogenous societal contexts. This paper takes a previously calibrated sociohydrology model and applies an idealized implementation, in order to: (i) explore the sensitivity of emergent dynamics resulting from bidirectional feedbacks to assumptions regarding (a) internal system properties that control the internal dynamics of the coupled system and (b) the external sociopolitical context; and (ii) interpret the results within the context of water resource management decision making. The analysis investigates feedback behavior in three ways, (a) via a global sensitivity analysis on key parameters and assessment of relevant model outputs, (b) through a comparative analysis based on hypothetical placement of the catchment along various points on the international sociopolitical gradient, and (c) by assessing the effects of various direct management intervention scenarios. Results indicate the presence of optimum windows that might offer the greatest positive impact per unit of management effort. Results further advocate management tools that encourage an adaptive learning, community-based approach with respect to water management, which are found to enhance centralized policy measures. This paper demonstrates that it is possible to use a place-based sociohydrology model to make abstractions as to the dynamics of bidirectional feedback behavior, and provide insights as to the efficacy of water management tools under different circumstances.",,"Elshafei, Y|Tonts, M|Sivapalan, M|Hipsey, MR",WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,sociohydrology threshold behavior adaptive water resource management social responses coupled system feedbacks coupled human-water systems,10.1002/2015WR017944

Not only parameter values are uncertain but often also the mass and timing of application. By introducing transformation products (TPs) into modelling, further uncertainty, coming from the dependence of these substances on their parent compounds and the introduction of new model parameters, is likely. The purpose of this study was the investigation of the behaviour of a parsimonious catchment scale model for the assessment of river concentrations of the insecticide Chlorpyrifos (CP) and its two main TPs, Chlorpyrifos Oxon (CPO) and ,,-trichloro--pyridinol (TCP) under the influence of uncertain input parameter values. Especially parameter uncertainty and pesticide application uncertainty were investigated by Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA) and the Generalized Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation (GLUE) method, based on Monte-Carlo sampling. GSA revealed that half-lives and sorption parameters as well as half-lives and transformation parameters were correlated to each other. This means the concepts of modelling sorption and degradation/transformation were correlated. Thus, it may be difficult in modelling studies to optimise parameter values for these modules. Furthermore, we could show that erroneous pesticide application mass and timing were compensated during Monte-Carlo sampling by changing the half-life of CP. However, the introduction of TCP into the calculation of the objective function was able to enhance the identifiability of pesticide application mass. The GLUE analysis showed that CP and TCP were modelled sufficiently, but CPO modelling failed with high uncertainty and insensitive parameters. We assumed a structural error of the model which was especially important for CPO assessment. This shows there is the possibility that a chemical and some of its TPs can be modelled successfully by a specific model structure, but for other TPs the model structure may not be suitable. Concluding, this study confirmed that the introduction of TPs into pesticide fate and export modelling from hydrological catchments amplifies parameter uncertainty and model structure uncertainty.

Numerical models of VFS such as the Vegetative Filter Scrip Modeling System (VFSMOD-W) are capable of predicting runoff, sediment, and pesticide reduction and can be useful tools to understand the effectiveness of VFS and environmental conditions under which they may be ineffective. However, as part of the modeling process, it is critical to identify input factor importance and quantify uncertainty in predicted runoff, sediment, and pesticide reductions, This research used state-of-the-art global sensitivity and uncertainty analysis tools, a screening method (Morris) and a variance-based method (extended Fourier Analysis Sensitivity Test), to evaluate VFSMOD-W under a range of field scenarios. Tie three VFS studies analyzed were conducted on silty clay loam and silt loam soils under uniform, sheet flow conditions and included atrazine, chlorpyrifos, cyanazine, metolachlor, pendimethalin, and terbuthylazine data. Saturated hydraulic conductivity was the most important input factor for predicting infiltration and runoff, explaining >% of the total output variance for studies with smaller hydraulic loading rates (similar to - mm equivalent depths) and similar to % for the higher loading rate (similar to -mm equivalent depth). Important input factors for predicting sedimentation included hydraulic conductivity, average particle size, and the filter's Manning's roughness coefficient. Input factor importance for pesticide trapping was controlled by infiltration and, therefore, hydraulic conductivity. Global uncertainty analyses suggested a wide range of reductions for runoff (% confidence intervals of -%), sediment (-%), and pesticide (-%). Pesticide trapping probability distributions fell between runoff and sediment reduction distributions as a function of the pesticides' sorption. Seemingly equivalent VFS exhibited unique and complex trapping responses dependent on the hydraulic and sediment loading rates, and therefore, process-based modeling of VFS is required.",,"Munoz-Carpena, R|Fox, GA|Sabbagh, GJ",JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY,,10.2134/jeq2009.0300

The valley was glaciated during the Late Pleistocene, and subsequently experienced a catastrophic rock avalanche leading to the formation of one of the largest mass movement landforms in North Africa. Recent research (Hughes et al., GSA Bulletin : -) has dated the formation of the rock avalanche to the mid-Holocene at . +/- . ka. In this paper, we examine the sedimentological (organic matter content, magnetic susceptibility, particle size and XRF) and palaeoecological (pollen and spores, non pollen palynomorphs (NPPs), microcharcoal and conifer tracheid fragments) record of a small infilled basin located adjacent to a Late Pleistocene moraine and close to the rock avalanche in the Arroumd sector. The deposits, primarily fine-grained and minerogenic with a low concentration of organic microfossils including pollen, coprophilous ascospores, wood and charcoal microfragments, are enriched in fine silts and ferrimagnetic minerals, consistent with erosional sources from surrounding slope soils. Three radiocarbon dates from the deposit indicate that the infill event occurred during the first millennium AD (after - AD). As such, the deposits point to a phase of slope instability and erosion that is not linked to either deglaciation processes or to the mid -Holocene rock avalanche. Instead, the nature and timing suggest that an anthropogenic trigger of degradation to the natural vegetation cover may be implicated, consistent with an increasing scale and intensity of pastoral activity in the southern High Atlas during the early Islamic period in Morocco. The record casts light on a previously undocumented phase of landscape instability in the dynamic setting of the Assif n'Imserdane valley, and highlights the potential for further exploration of small infilled basins in the High Atlas to illuminate the geoecological history of the region.", (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Global approaches to sensitivity analyses (GSA) which would obviate these shortcomings, are applied by a minority of researchers. By reviewing the academic literature on SA, we here present a bibliometric analysis of the trends of different SA practices in last decade. The review has been conducted both on some top ranking journals (Nature and Science) and through an extended analysis in the Elsevier's Scopus database of scientific publications. After correcting for the global growth in publications, the amount of papers performing a generic SA has notably increased over the last decade. Even if OAT is still the most largely used technique in SA, there is a clear increase in the use of GSA with preference respectively for regression and variance-based techniques. Even after adjusting for the growth of publications in the sole modelling field, to which SA and GSA normally apply, the trend is confirmed. Data about regions of origin and discipline are also briefly discussed.

The model solves the nonlinear bidimensional (D) and one-dimensional (D) Saint-Venant equations to compute respectively the surface runoff and the flow in the sewer network. The sensitivity of the outlet hydrograph to the input parameters of the model was determined by using variance-based Sobol sensitivity indices. These indices highlight the great effect of the overland flow parameters on the model output, in contrast with the limited effect of the sewer-network parameters. The Manning coefficient of the impervious terrains was identified as the most influential model parameter. The effect on model calibration of two subjective factors of the GLUE methodology (the acceptability threshold and the shaping factor of the likelihood function) was analyzed. From this analysis, a NSE acceptability threshold of . and a shaping factor of  were adopted for model calibration. Greater values of these parameters resulted in very narrow uncertainty bounds and therefore in low coverage ratios. The results obtained after calibration and validation show a satisfactory performance of the model, with NSE values within . and . and coverage ratios of the % confidence intervals in the range -%.

However, complex models, for example, the so-called physically based models, possess large degrees of freedom that, if not constrained properly, may lead to poor model performance when used for prediction. We argue that constraining a model to represent streamflow, which is an integrated resultant of many factors across the watershed, is necessary but by no means sufficient to develop a high-fidelity model. To address this problem, we develop a framework to utilize the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment's (GRACE) total water storage anomaly data as a supplement to streamflows for model calibration, in a multiobjective setting. The VARS method (Variogram Analysis of Response Surfaces) for global sensitivity analysis is used to understand the model behaviour with respect to streamflow and GRACE data, and the BORG multiobjective optimization method is applied for model calibration. Two subbasins of the Saskatchewan River Basin in Western Canada are used as a case study. Results show that the developed framework is superior to the conventional approach of calibration only to streamflows, even when multiple streamflow-based error functions are simultaneously minimized. It is shown that a range of (possibly false) system trajectories in state variable space can lead to similar (acceptable) model responses. This observation has significant implications for land-surface and hydrologic model development and, if not addressed properly, may undermine the credibility of the model in prediction.

Low Impact Development (LID) techniques have proven to be a viable and effective alternative by reducing stormwater runoff and increasing the infiltration and evapotranspiration capacity of urban areas. However, the lack of adequate modeling tools represents a barrier in designing and constructing such systems. This paper investigates the suitability of a mechanistic model, HYDRUS-D, to correctly describe the hydraulic behavior of permeable pavement installed at the University of Calabria. Two different scenarios of describing the hydraulic behavior of the permeable pavement system were analyzed: the first one uses a single porosity model for all layers of the permeable pavement; the second one uses a dual-porosity model for the base and sub-base layers. Measured and modeled month-long hydrographs were compared using the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) index. A Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA) followed by a Monte Carlo filtering highlighted the influence of the wear layer on the hydraulic behavior of the pavement and identified the ranges of parameters generating behavioral solutions. Reduced ranges were then used in the calibration procedure conducted with the metaheuristic Particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm for the estimation of hydraulic parameters. The best fit value for the first scenario was NSE = .; for the second scenario, it was NSE = ., indicating that the dual-porosity approach is more appropriate for describing the variably-saturated flow in the base and sub-base layers. Estimated parameters were validated using an independent, month-long set of measurements, resulting in NSE values of . and . for the first and second scenarios, respectively. The improvement in correspondence between measured and modeled hydrographs confirmed the reliability of the combination of GSA and PSO in dealing with highly dimensional optimization problems. Obtained results have demonstrated that PSO, due to its easiness of implementation and effectiveness, can represent a new and viable alternative to traditional optimization algorithms for the inverse estimation of unsaturated hydraulic properties.

Eighty percent ( groups) of the measured data were selected randomly as the training database. The other % ( groups) of data were used as testing data. Finally, the approach was applied to predict six debris flow gullies velocities in the Wudongde Dam site area, where environmental conditions were similar to the Jiangjia gully. The modified Dongchuan empirical equation and the pulled particle analysis of debris flow (PPA) approach were used for comparison and validation.

Although the application of both techniques provides a comprehensive understanding of model behaviour, they are seldom practised in combination. In this study, the Sobol global sensitivity method and the multiobjective algorithm AMALGAM are combined to assess the agro-hydrological SWAP model for simulating the soil water balance of different sole and mixed crops based on hydrological and phenological field observations. Fifteen unknown model parameters are subjected to the sensitivity analysis (GSA) with the aim of finding their importance to model performance of matric potential (F-) and soil water content (F-). Subsequently, sensitive parameters are calibrated by optimising F- and F- simultaneously. The GSA showed that the description of the rooting density and potential evapotranspiration is of crucial important to F-, and that soil properties are most relevant for F-. Parameter interactions played a primary role in the response of matric potential, being irrelevant for F-. Structural model deficiencies in reproducing both objectives simultaneously were found in the multiobjective analysis, meaning that deterioration in the fit to one of the objectives is in favour of the other. However, solutions exist that produce satisfying fits to both observational types, suggesting that the SWAP model has the capability of simulating the soil water balance of the crops considered. The results of the evaluation period revealed model deficiencies in simulating the process under an environmental regime significantly different from that of the calibration period, indicating the necessity of acquiring a broader spectrum of environmental regimes for parameter calibration.

Two mathematical concepts are used to characterize the geometry of these spaces and to identify possible impacts of variability in data or changes in the models or solution procedures: the dimension of the maximal free generator subspace in vector spaces and the principal angles between subspaces. We show how these characters can be used as indications on the aleatory and epistemic uncertainties. In the case of large dimensional parameter spaces, these characterizations are established for quantile-based extreme scenarios and a multi-point moment-based sensitivity direction permits to propose a directional uncertainty quantification concept for directional extreme scenarios (DES). The approach is non-intrusive and exploits in parallel the elements of existing mono-point gradient-based design platforms. The ingredients of the paper are illustrated on a model problem with the Burgers equation with control and on a constrained aerodynamic performance analysis problem.", (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.,"Mohammadi, B",COMPUTER METHODS IN APPLIED MECHANICS AND ENGINEERING,uncertainty quantification non-intrusive worst-case analysis value at risk parallelism robust design,10.1016/j.cma.2014.07.021

A well known and widely used method to circumvent this inconvenience consists in replacing the complex computer code by a reduced model, called a metamodel, or a response surface that represents the computer code and requires acceptable calculation time. One particular class of metamodels is studied: the Gaussian process model that is characterized by its mean and covariance functions. A specific estimation procedure is developed to adjust a Gaussian process model in complex cases (non-linear relations, highly dispersed or discontinuous output, high-dimensional input, inadequate sampling designs, etc.). The efficiency of this algorithm is compared to the efficiency of other existing algorithms on an analytical test case. The proposed methodology is also illustrated for the case of a complex hydrogeological computer code, simulating radionuclide transport in groundwater.", (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

However, uncertainty in current memory estimates is not clear and it is not obvious to what extent these are dependent on model uncertainties. To address this question, we perform a global sensitivity analysis of memory to key hydraulic parameters, using an uncoupled version of the H-TESSEL land surface model. Results show significant dependency of estimates of memory and its uncertainty on these parameters, suggesting that operational seasonal forecasting models using deterministic hydraulic parameter values are likely to display a narrower range of memory than exists in reality. Explicitly incorporating hydraulic parameter uncertainty into models may then give improvements in forecast skill and reliability, as has been shown elsewhere in the literature.

Monitoring activities were performed to assess the level of contamination; however, these were costly, laborious, and short-term leading to insufficient monitoring data. However, the performance of the existing Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT model) can be restricted by its two-phase partitioning approach, which is inadequate when it comes to simulating pesticides with limited dataset. This study developed a modified SWAT pesticide model to address these challenges. The modified model considered the three-phase partitioning model that classifies the pesticide into three forms: dissolved, particle-bound, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC)-associated pesticide. The addition of DOC-associated pesticide particles increases the scope of the pesticide model by also considering the adherence of pesticides to the organic carbon in the soil. The modified SWAT and original SWAT pesticide model was applied to the Pagsanjan-Lumban (PL) basin, a highly agricultural region. Malathion was chosen as the target pesticide since it is commonly used in the basin. The pesticide models simulated the fate and transport of malathion in the PL basin and showed the temporal pattern of selected subbasins. The sensitivity analyses revealed that application efficiency and settling velocity were the most sensitive parameters for the original and modified SWAT model, respectively. Degradation of particulate-phase malathion were also significant to both models. The rate of determination (R-) and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) values showed that the modified model (R- = .; NSE = .) gave a slightly better performance compared to the original (R- = .; NSE = .).

The CCSD integrated approach determines the weights of attributes by considering SD of each attribute and their CCs with the overall assessment of decision alternatives, where CCs are determined by removing each attribute from the overall assessment of decision alternatives. If the CC for an attribute turns out to be very high, then the removal of this attribute has little effect on decision making; otherwise, the attribute should be given an important weight. The global sensitivity analysis to the weights of attributes is proposed to ensure the stability of the best decision alternative or alternative ranking. A numerical example about the economic benefit assessment of the industrial economy of China is investigated to illustrate the potential applications of the CCSD method in determining the weights of attributes.

This paper proposes a sequential Bayesian approach that incorporates the effect sparsity and hierarchy principles to identify sparse polynomial chaos metamodels. A hierarchical Bayesian model is employed for model selection, and the best metamodel is identified by optimizing the posterior model probability. Explicit expressions for important posterior quantities are derived. A sequential procedure is proposed in which experiment runs are added until changes in the posterior mean of the coefficients of the polynomial metamodel are small. Point and interval estimates of sensitivity indices are obtained via simulation from the posterior distribution of the model coefficients conditioned on the highest posterior probability model.

The simulation model requires an uncertainty analysis, and incorporating the results into the SEAR strategy optimization process is critical. However, previous studies have rarely involved corresponding problems. In the present study, an uncertainty analysis is performed by combining a Monte Carlo random simulation with the Sobol' global sensitivity analysis to assess the contribution of different parameters to the remediation efficiency and distribution characteristics of the simulation model outputs. The surrogate model technique based on Kriging was used to reduce the high computational load of the sensitivity and uncertainty analyses. The results of the sensitivity analysis showed that the porosity is the most important parameter with the largest influence on the remediation efficiency at a weight of %, followed by the oleic phase dispersity at a weight of %; the influence from variations in other parameters can be neglected. The rebuilt surrogate model with fewer input variables performed significantly better than the one built before the sensitivity analysis for all performance evaluation indices.

In this study, we coupled a stream model with a terrestrial ecohydrological model and conducted a global sensitivity analysis to evaluate the relative importance of both ecosystems to nitrogen export. We constructed two scenarios (normal and high nitrate loads) to explore conditions under which terrestrial (lateral nitrate flux) or aquatic ecosystems (instream nutrient processes) may be more important in controlling DIN export. In a forest catchment, although the forest ecosystem controls the nitrogen load to streams, sensitivity results suggested that most nitrogen output from the terrestrial ecosystem was taken up by instream microbial immobilization associated with benthic detritus and retained in detritus. Later the immobilized nitrogen was remineralized as DIN. Therefore, the intra-annual pattern of DIN concentration in the stream was low in fall and became high in spring. Not only was instream microbial immobilization saturated with the high nitrogen load scenario, but also the net effect of immobilization and mineralization on DIN export was minimized because nitrogen cycling between organic and inorganic forms was accelerated. Overall, our linked terrestrial-aquatic model simulations demonstrated that stream process could significantly affect the amount and timing of watershed nitrogen export when nitrogen export from the terrestrial system is low. However, when nitrogen export from the terrestrial system is high, the effect of stream processes is minimal.",,"Lin, L|Webster, JR|Hwang, T|Band, LE",WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,nitrogen export terrestrial nitrogen flux instream immobilization instream mineralization global sensitivity analysis,10.1002/2014WR015962

In particular, sea level rise associated with climate change can drastically affect wetlands and beaches which are important foraging and nesting areas of these organisms. SLAMM  (Sea Level Affecting Marshes Model) is widely used to simulate wetland conversion and shoreline modification for the purpose of habitat vulnerability assessment and decision making, but concerns regarding the suitability of the model due to the uncertainty involved in selecting many of the model's empirical input parameters have been expressed. This paper applies a generic evaluation framework consisting of a state-of-the-art screening and variance-based global sensitivity and uncertainty analyses to simulate changes in the coastal habitats of the barrier island in Eglin Air Force Base, Florida in order to: () identify the important input factors and processes that control SLAMM 's output uncertainty; () quantify SLAMM 's global output uncertainty and apportion it to the direct contributions and interactions of the important input factors; and () evaluate this new methodology to explore the potential fate of the coastal habitats of the study area. Results showed that four input factors (DEM vertical error for the lower elevation range, historic trend of sea level rise, accretion, and sedimentation rates) controlled -% of SLAMM 's output variance in predicting changes in the beach habitat of Eglin Air Force Base. The most dominant processes governing the fate of the coastline of the study area were inundation (i.e. reduction in elevation due to sea level rise) and accretion/sedimentation. Interestingly, for lower elevation habitats (salt marsh, tidal flat, and beach), results showed possible gain or loss of these habitats depending on the relative strength of these processes resulting from the combination of input factors within their proposed uncertainty ranges. Higher-elevation habitats (swamps and inland fresh marsh) showed decrease in area over  years of simulation. These findings are important to implement managerial schemes in the area to protect threatened Plover birds (Charadrius sp.) communities.

An updated version of the SCOPE model was used here (v.) which contains novel leaf physiological modules for determination of the steady state fluorescence yield: a photosynthesis model coupled with (a) submodels having empirically derived relationships, identified as TB for unstressed and TB-D for drought conditions and (b) a mechanistic (MD) submodel based on theoretical relationships. By inspecting Sobol's total order (main effect and all the interactions) sensitivity index (S-Ti) rankings, the influential and non-influential variables were determined. Two experiments were conducted for the different leaf physiology modules in SCOPE considering () only vegetation variables, and () all SCOPE variables, i.e., including micrometeorological, aerodynamic and geometry variables. Considering TB-D S-Ti results using only vegetation input variables, the canopy-leaving broadband (- nm) SIF variability was determined mainly by leaf optical properties and canopy structural variables. The most important variables were (with decreasing importance) leaf chlorophyll content (Cab), leaf inclination (LIDFa) and leaf area index (LA!). These three variables alone determined .% of the SIF variability. V-cmo, the variable related to photosynthetic capacity, determined .% of overall SIF variability, and its importance declined considerably when moving from the first emission peak (SIFred; with maximal relevance of .% at  nm) to the second emission peak (SIFNIR; e.g., .% at  nm). Stronger relationships with V-cmo, were obtained when retrieving the full broadband SIF flux and calculating total fluorescence yield (F-yield, determined as the integral of the hemispherical broadband SIF flux divided by the total absorbed PAR), of which % of the variability was influenced by V-cmo. Using the TB submodel, the major drivers of SIF flux were similar to TB-D except that V-cmo accounted for very little (<%) variability. The MD submodel identified the components of long-term PSII photoprotection and photodamage as the dominant factors for SIF variability: these two variables alone accounted for .% of the variability of SIF flux and % of F-yield, whereas V-cmo explained only .% and .% of variability in SIF flux and F-yield, respectively. Analysis of the relative importance of all SCOPE variables revealed that in addition to the key vegetation variables, micrometeorological variables were important in driving SIF variability, especially incoming shortwave radiation (Rin) and to a lesser extent air temperature (Ta), atmospheric vapor pressure (ea) and atmospheric CO concentration (Ca). Their impact further reduced the relative importance of V-cmo. The GSA experiments led to the following conclusions: () explicit knowledge of key variables driving the SIF flux is essential in order to achieve unbiased SIF interpretation related to photosynthetic activity at local and global scales; () information related to photosynthetic activity is found more in the first emission peak (SIFred) than in the second peak (SIFNIR), and more in the full broadband SIF emission, which allows calculation of F-yield, than in individual wavebands.", (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

This study presents a procedure for identifying the major sources of uncertainty in a conceptual lumped dynamic stormwater runoff quality model that is used in a study catchment to estimate (i) copper loads, (ii) compliance with dissolved Cu concentration limits on stormwater discharge and (iii) the fraction of Cu loads potentially intercepted by a planned treatment facility. The analysis is based on the combination of variance-decomposition Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA) with the Generalized Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation (GLUE) technique. The GSA-GLUE approach highlights the correlation between the model factors defining the mass of pollutant in the system and the importance of considering hydrological parameters as source of uncertainty when calculating Cu loads and concentrations due to their influence. The influence of hydrological parameters on simulated concentrations changes during rain events. Four informal likelihood measures are used to quantify model prediction bounds. The width of the uncertainty bounds depends on the likelihood measure, with the inverse variance based likelihood more suitable for covering measured pollutographs. Uncertainty for simulated concentration is higher than for Cu loads, which again shows lower uncertainty compared to studies neglecting the hydrological submodel as source of uncertainty. A combined likelihood measure ensuring both good predictions in flow and concentration is used to identify the parameter sets used for long time simulations.

However, the uncertainty on the model predictions is sometimes too high to draw proper conclusions. Because of the complexity of process based river water quality models, it is best to investigate this problem according to the origin of the uncertainty. If the uncertainty stems from input data or parameter uncertainty, more reliable results are obtained by performing specific measurement campaigns. The aim of the research reported in this paper is to guide these measurement campaigns based on an uncertainty analysis. The practical case study is the river Dender in Flanders, Belgium. First an overview of different techniques that give valuable information for the reduction of input and parameter uncertainty is given. A global sensitivity analysis shows the importance of the different uncertainty sources. Further an analysis of the uncertainty bands is performed to find differences in uncertainty between certain periods or locations. This shows that the link between periods with high uncertainty and specific circumstances (climatological, eco-regional, etc.) can help in gathering data for the calibration of submodels (e.g. diffuse pollution vs. point pollution).

In this study greenhouse water demand was modeled using artificial neural networks trained with a dataset containing eight input factors for a commercial greenhouse growing bell peppers. The dataset contained water usage, climatic and temporal data for the years -. This model was then evaluated using the Extended Fourier Amplitude Sensitivity Test, a global sensitivity analysis, in order to determine the importance, or sensitivity, of each input factor. It was found that time of day, solar radiation, and outdoor temperature (degrees C) had the largest effects on the model output. These outputs could be used to contribute to the generation of a simplified demand-forecasting model.",,"Rice, DCJ|Carriveau, R|Ting, DSK",WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-WATER SUPPLY,commercial greenhouse watering neural network sensitivity analysis water demand characterization,10.2166/ws.2016.031

Understanding groundwater flows to these ecologically sensitive bodies is important for coastal environmental sustainability. A management-oriented mathematical model capable of simulating the flow of groundwater into a coastal bay (i.e., submarine groundwater discharge) is developed here using the principles of quasi-steady-state flow and the existence of a sharp interface between the freshwater and the saltwater portions of the aquifer. The model is applied to the Baffin Bay in South Texas, a hypersaline coastal body with no major river discharges. Two global sensitivity approaches (the one-at-a time design; OAT) and the grid-based Monte Carlo sensitivity index are used to identify critical model inputs. The sensitivity of the model inputs to the Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) criterion is calculated making use of synoptic observed SGD measurements made over a period of one tidal cycle. The results of the study indicate that global sensitivity analysis methods are particularly sensitive to the number of model realizations. The ability of these techniques to screen out insensitive model inputs increased with increasing number of realizations. The variability in the identified inputs was more prominent with the OAT sensitivity methods than Monte Carlo-based techniques. In general, the aquifer properties (hydraulic conductivity and aquifer thickness) as well as fluid properties (seawater and fresh water densities) along with the antecedent SGD was noted to be the most sensitive parameters. This result indicates that the implementation of sharp-front coastal-aquifer models can be improved through better hydrogeologic characterization and measuring temperature and salinity data to improve density estimation. The global sensitivity methods also help identify reasonable values for model inputs which can serve as a starting point for advanced calibrations. The results, however, indicated that the model is likely over-parameterized with different input sets yielding similar NSE estimates. Based on these initial parameter estimates, the model was able to capture the general trend in the observed SGD but could not capture the dynamic associated with high water levels in the bay. Pre-calibration global sensitivity analysis is recommended in similar applications as it not only provides insights into future data collection efforts but can also help assess the likely success of model calibration. However, given the variability among the techniques, it is suggested that multiple global sensitivity methods be utilized.",,"Uddameri, V|Hernandez, EA|Singaraju, S",ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES,submarine groundwater discharges saltwater wedge profile global sensitivity parameter identification baffin bay texas,10.1007/s12665-013-2898-6

It highlights the most important set of model parameters to determine whether data quality needs to be improved, and to enhance interpretation of results. Interactions within the LCA calculation model and correlations within Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) input parameters are two main issues among the LCA calculation process. Here we propose a methodology for conducting a proper SA which takes into account the effects of these two issues. This study first presents the SA in an uncorrelated case, comparing local and independent global sensitivity analysis. Independent global sensitivity analysis aims to analyze the variability of results because of the variation of input parameters over the whole domain of uncertainty, together with interactions among input parameters. We then apply a dependent global sensitivity approach that makes minor modifications to traditional Sobol indices to address the correlation issue. Finally, we propose some guidelines for choosing the appropriate SA method depending on the characteristics of the model and the goals of the study.

The basic idea is based on the fact that leakage-induced pressure signals travel much faster than the migrating CO; thus such anomalies may be detected early enough for risk management measures taking effect in avoiding substantial CO leaks. The early detection methodology involves automatic inversion of anomalous brine leakage signals with efficient forward pressure and surface-deformation modeling tools to estimate the location and permeability of leaky features in the caprock. We conduct a global sensitivity analysis to better understand under which conditions pressure anomalies can be clearly identified as leakage signals, and evaluate signal detectability for a broad parameter range considering different detection limits and levels of data noise. The inverse methodology is then applied to two synthetic examples of idealized two-aquifer-and-one aquitard storage systems, with an injection well and a leaky well, for different monitoring scenarios. In Example , only pressure data at the monitoring and injection wells are used for leakage detection. Our results show that the accuracy of leakage detection greatly depends on the level of pressure data noise. In Example , joint inversion of pressure and surface-deformation measurements significantly improves the speed of convergence toward the true solution of the leakage parameters and enables early leakage detection. In both examples, successful detection is achieved when two monitoring wells are appropriately placed within up to  km from the leaky well.", Published by Elsevier Ltd.,"Jung, YJ|Zhou, QL|Birkholzer, JT",ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES,geologic carbon storage risk assessment early leakage detection leakage-induced monitoring data joint inversion,10.1016/j.advwatres.2013.06.008

In this study, we performed a temporal global sensitivity analysis using the variance-based method of Sobol' and a temporal identifiability analysis of model parameters using the dynamic identifiability method (DYNIA). We discuss the relationship between the two analyses with a focus on parameter identification and output uncertainty reduction. The hydrological model HydroGeoSphere was used to simulate daily evapotranspiration, water content, and seepage at the lysimeter scale. We found that identifiability of a parameter does not necessarily reduce output uncertainty.

The HL-RDHM's sensitivities were assessed for annual and monthly periods using distributed forcing and identical model parameters for all grid cells at -hour and -hour model time steps respectively for two case study watersheds within the Juniata River Basin in central Pennsylvania. This study also provides detailed spatial analysis of the HL-RDHM's sensitivities for two flood events based on -hour model time steps selected to demonstrate how strongly the spatial heterogeneity of forcing influences the model's spatial sensitivities. Our verification analysis of the sensitivity analysis method demonstrates that the method provides robust sensitivity rankings and that these rankings could be used to significantly reduce the number of parameters that should be considered when calibrating the HL-RDHM.

Density function and statistical moments of the solution are obtained by means of quadrature rules if inputs are uncorrelated and uniformly distributed. Otherwise, the Monte Carlo analysis can run inexpensively using obtained sparse approximation. An adaptive technique to sample from a multivariate density function using sparse grid is proposed to reduce the number of required sampling points.

A new numerical model termed ISOtope-based FLuvial Organic Carbon (ISOFLOC) is formulated to simulate the fluvial organic carbon budget in watersheds where hydrologic, sediment transport, and biogeochemical processes are coupled to control benthic and transported carbon composition and flux. One ISOFLOC innovation is the formulation of new stable carbon isotope model subroutines that include isotope fractionation processes in order to estimate carbon isotope source, fate, and transport. A second innovation is the coupling of transfers between carbon pools, including algal particulate organic carbon, fine particulate and dissolved organic carbon, and particulate and dissolved inorganic carbon, to simulate the carbon cycle in a comprehensive manner beyond that of existing watershed water quality models. ISOFLOC was tested and verified in a low-gradient, agriculturally impacted stream. Results of a global sensitivity analysis suggested the isotope response variable had unique sensitivity to the coupled interaction between fluvial shear resistance of algal biomass and the concentration of dissolved inorganic carbon.

However, one of the key challenges for experimental design is that the local sensitivity is dependent on the unknown parameter values for a nonlinear model. This problem can be addressed if the sensitivity matrix, used in experimental design, could be computed by global sensitivity analysis techniques rather than local sensitivity analysis methods. However, not all existing global sensitivity analysis measures can compute such a sensitivity matrix. This paper presents a necessary condition for integrating global sensitivity analysis with experimental design criteria, i.e., the design criterion of the global sensitivity matrix reduces to the one applied to the local sensitivity matrix if the parameter uncertainty range tends to zero. Four different sensitivity measures are analyzed using this condition and the results are illustrated in a detailed case study where a comparison with local design and Bayesian design is made.

Although Geobacter species are reducing U(VI), they primarily grow via Fe(III) reduction. Unfortunately, the biogeochemistry and the physiology of simultaneous reduction of multiple metals are still poorly understood. A detailed model is therefore required to better understand the pathways leading to U(VI) and Fe(III) reduction by Geobacter species. Based on recent experimental evidence of temporary electron capacitors in Geobacter we propose a novel kinetic model that physically distinguishes planktonic cells into electron-loaded and -unloaded states. Incorporation of an electron load-unload cycle into the model provides insight into U(VI) reduction efficiency, and elucidates the relationship between U(VI)- and Fe(III)-reducing activity and further explains the correlation of high U(VI) removal with high fractions of planktonic cells in subsurface environments. Global sensitivity analysis was used to determine the level of importance of geochemical and microbial processes controlling Geobacter growth and U(VI) reduction, suggesting that the electron load-unload cycle and the resulting repartition of the microbes between aqueous and attached phases are critical for U(VI) reduction.

This is particularly true for species whose habitat is threatened by climate change that enhances the uncertainty in future species distributions. Global sensitivity and uncertainty analyses (GSUA) is a robust method to globally investigate the uncertainty of SDMs and the importance of species distributions' drivers in space and time. Here we apply GSUA to MAXENT that is one of the popular presence-only SDMs. We consider the Snowy Plover (Charadrius alexandrinus nivosus) (SP) in Florida that is a shorebird whose habitat is affected by sea level rise due to climate change. The importance of intrinsic and exogenous input factors to the uncertainty of the species distribution is evaluated for MAXENT. GSUA is applied for three projections of the habitat (, , and ) according to the AB sea level rise scenario. The large land cover variation determines a moderate decrease in habitat suitability in  and  prospecting a low risk of decline for the SP. The regularization parameter for the environmental features, the uncertainty into the classification of salt-marsh, transitional marsh, and ocean beach, and the maximum number of iterations for the model training are in this order the most important input factors for the average habitat suitability. These results are related to the SP but, in general MAXENT appears as a very non-linear model where uncertainty mostly derives from the interactions among input factors. The uncertainty of the output is a species-specific variable. Thus, GSUA need be performed for each case considering local exogenous input factors of the model. GSUA allows quantitative informed species-management decisions by providing scenarios with controlled uncertainty and confidence over factors' importance that can be used by resource managers.

This paper describes such a comprehensive modeling framework that includes microbially mediated degradation processes, microbial population growth and decay, geochemical reactions, as well as interphase mass transfer processes such as DNAPL dissolution, gas formation and mineral precipitation/dissolution. All these processes can be in equilibrium or kinetically controlled. A batch modeling example was presented where the degradation of trichloroethene (ICE) and its byproducts and concomitant reactions (e.g., electron donor fermentation, sulfate reduction, pH buffering by calcite dissolution) were simulated. Local and global sensitivity analysis techniques were applied to delineate the dominant model parameters and processes. Sensitivity analysis indicated that accurate values for parameters related to dichloroethene (DCE) and vinyl chloride (VC) degradation (i.e., DCE and VC maximum utilization rates, yield due to DCE utilization, decay rate for DCE/VC dechlorinators) are important for prediction of the overall dechlorination time. These parameters influence the maximum growth rate of the DCE and VC dechlorinating microorganisms and, thus, the time required for a small initial population to reach a sufficient concentration to significantly affect the overall rate of dechlorination. Self-inhibition of chlorinated ethenes at high concentrations and natural buffering provided by the sediment were also shown to significantly influence the dechlorination time. Furthermore, the analysis indicated that the rates of the competing, nonchlorinated electron-accepting processes relative to the dechlorination kinetics also affect the overall dechlorination time. Results demonstrated that the model developed is a flexible research tool that is able to provide valuable insight into the fundamental processes and their complex interactions during bioremediation of chlorinated ethenes in DNAPL source zones.

Bayesian statistics and global sensitivity analysis allow to reduce uncertainties in parameters and outputs, and they provide better insight of model behaviour. In this work two versions of a process-based model that differed in the autotrophic respiration modelling were analysed. The original version (PGN) was based on a constant ratio between net and gross primary production, while in a new version (PGN*) the autotrophic respiration was modelled as a function of temperature and biomass. A Bayesian framework, and a global sensitivity analysis (Morris method) were used to reduce parametric uncertainty, to highlight strengths and weaknesses of the models and to evaluate their performances. The Bayesian approach allowed also to identify the weaknesses and strengths of the dataset used for the analyses. The Morris method in combination with the Bayesian framework helped to identify key parameters and gave a deeper understanding of model behaviour. Both model versions reliably predicted average stand diameter at breast height, average stand height, stand volume and stem biomass.

The conventional gravitational search algorithm (GSA) is a memory-less heuristic optimization algorithm based on Newton's laws of gravitation. Therefore, the positions of agents only depend on the optimal solutions of previous iteration. In GSA, there is always a chance to lose optimal trajectory because of not utilizing the best solution from previous iterations of the optimization process. This drawback reduces the performance of GSA when dealing with complicated optimization problems. However, the MBGSA uses the overall best solution of the agents from previous iterations in the calculation of agents' positions. Consequently, the agents try to improve their positions by always searching around overall best solutions. The performance of the MBGSA is evaluated by solving fourteen standard benchmark optimization problems and the results are compared with GSA and modified GSA (MGSA).

The influence of the three following parameters has been studied: the measurement error, the level of details of above-ground elements representation and the spatial discretization resolution. To introduce uncertainty, a Probability Density Function and discrete spatial approach have been applied to generate , DEMs. Based on a D urban flood river event modelling, the produced sensitivity maps highlight the major influence of modeller choices compared to HR measurement errors when HR topographic data are used.

Considering a D-dimensional space, this paper introduces a new random search algorithm called vector-based swarm optimization (VBSO). In this method, vectors with appropriate orientation gradually converge to a global optimum point. In the VBSO, random weighting coefficients are used with a predetermined strategy. Using multiplication of these coefficients by suitable vectors, the randomness property is provided. Taking same conditions into account, the proposed algorithm is compared with a number of well-known intuitive algorithms. Considering  unimodal and multimodal benchmark functions, simulation results confirm that the VBSO performs faster and more accurate than intuitive algorithms, such as CEP, FEP, GA, PSO, GSA, DE and ODE, in most cases. To evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm in coping with difficult situations, some challenging cases are considered. They may have large number of variables, few number of populations, few number of iterations, or may be shifted functions with huge number of optimums.

Sobol' sensitivity analysis has proven to be a valuable tool for diagnostic analyses of hydrologic models. However, for many spatially distributed models, the Sobol' method requires a prohibitive number of model evaluations to reliably decompose output variance across the full set of parameters. We investigate the potential of the method of Morris, a screening-based sensitivity approach, to provide results sufficiently similar to those of the Sobol' method at a greatly reduced computational expense. The methods are benchmarked on the Hydrology Laboratory Research Distributed Hydrologic Model (HL-RDHM) over a six-month period in the Blue River watershed, Oklahoma, USA. The Sobol' method required over six million model evaluations to ensure reliable sensitivity indices, corresponding to more than   computing hours and roughly  gigabytes of storage space.

Integrating complex and often uncertain information into spatial PVA models requires that comprehensive sensitivity analyses be applied to explore the influence of spatial and nonspatial parameters on model predictions. We reviewed  analyses of spatial demographic PVA models of plants and animals to identify common approaches to sensitivity analysis in recent publications. In contrast to best practices recommended in the broader modeling community, sensitivity analyses of spatial PVAs were typically ad hoc, inconsistent, and difficult to compare. Most studies applied local approaches to sensitivity analyses, but few varied multiple parameters simultaneously. A lack of standards for sensitivity analysis and reporting in spatial PVAs has the potential to compromise the ability to learn collectively from PVA results, accurately interpret results in cases where model relationships include nonlinearities and interactions, prioritize monitoring and management actions, and ensure conservation-planning decisions are robust to uncertainties in spatial and nonspatial parameters.

However, the parameterization of lake and reservoir routines on a global scale is subject to considerable uncertainty due to lack of information on lake hydrographic characteristics and reservoir operating rules. In this study we estimated the effect of lakes and reservoirs on global daily streamflow simulations of a spatially distributed LISFLOOD hydrological model. We applied state-of-the-art global sensitivity and uncertainty analyses for selected catchments to examine the effect of uncertain lake and reservoir parameterization on model performance. Streamflow observations from  catchments around the globe and multiple performance measures were used to assess model performance. Results indicate a considerable geographical variability in the lake and reservoir effects on the stream flow simulation. Nash -Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) and Kling -Gupta Efficiency (KGE) metrics improved for % and.% of catchments respectively, with median skill score values of . and . while scores deteriorated for % and % of the catchments, with median values -. and -., respectively. The effect of reservoirs on extreme high flows was substantial and widespread in the global domain, while the effect of lakes was spatially limited to a few catchments. As indicated by global sensitivity analysis, parameter uncertainty substantially affected uncertainty of model performance. Reservoir parameters often contributed to this uncertainty, although the effect varied widely among catchments. The effect of reservoir parameters on model performance diminished with distance downstream of reservoirs in favor of other parameters, notably groundwater-related parameters and channel Manning's roughness coefficient. This study underscores the importance of accounting for lakes and, especially, reservoirs and using appropriate parameterization in large-scale hydrological simulations.

Multiyear datasets from the semi-arid Colorado Agricultural Meteorological (CoAgMet) and humid Florida Automated Weather Network (FAWN) networks were evaluated using a local sensitivity analysis (LSA) method which calculated the total error range of each individual sensor, as well as Morris and eFAST global sensitivity analysis (GSA) methods which simultaneously evaluated the full accuracy range of each sensor. Sensitivity of inputs (i.e., temperature, humidity, wind speed, and solar radiation) generally had values within the same range for the FAWN network with solar radiation being the most influential input in the Summer, while sensitivity to wind speed for the CoAgMet network was much higher than the other inputs. Due to its simplicity and ease of application, LSA is suggested as a minimal screening method for evaluating input sensor sensitivity. GSA results were highly correlated with each other, but local sensitivity was poorly correlated to GSA methods regarding wind input in Colorado. Uncertainty analysis showed the current configuration of sensors in the CoAgMet network to have a higher range of ET values between % and % confidence intervals, as compared to the FAWN network. The eFAST GSA method was applied using a hypothetical set of ""best case"" sensors in both stations (i.e., sensors with the best accuracy between both sites), showing solar radiation to be the most influential input in the high ET months of summer, and the sensitivity in Colorado to wind to be vastly decreased, suggesting that the CoAgMet network could benefit from an upgrade to more accurate anemometers.", Published by Elsevier B.V.,"DeJonge, KC|Ahmadi, M|Ascough, JC|Kinzli, KD",COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE,evapotranspiration sensitivity analysis instrumentation sensor accuracy irrigation water,10.1016/j.compag.2014.11.013

A weakness of global sensitivity and uncertainty analysis methodologies is the often subjective definition of prior parameter probability distributions, especially in data-poor areas. We apply Monte Carlo filtering in conjunction with quantitative variance-based global sensitivity and uncertainty analysis techniques to address this weakness and define parameter probability distributions in the absence of measured data. This general methodology is applied to a reservoir model of the Okavango Delta, Botswana. In addition to providing a methodology for setting prior parameter distributions, results show that the use of Monte Carlo filtering reduces model uncertainty and produces simulations that better represent the calibrated ranges. Thus, Monte Carlo filtering increases the accuracy and precision of parametric model uncertainty. Results also show that the most important parameters in our model are the volume thresholds, the reservoir area/volume coefficient, floodplain porosity, and the island extinction coefficient. The reservoir representing the central part of the wetland, where flood waters separate into several independent distributaries, is a keystone area within the model.

However, inaccurate conclusions can be drawn from models with a large degree of uncertainty around multiple parameter estimates if uncertainty is ignored. This is especially true in nonlinear systems with multiple interacting variables. We addressed these issues for a mechanism-based, demographic model of Populus fremontii (Fremont cottonwood), the dominant riparian tree species along southwestern U.S. rivers. Many cottonwood populations have declined following widespread floodplain conversion and flow regulation. As a result, accurate predictive models are needed to analyze effects of future climate change and water management decisions. To quantify effects of parameter uncertainty, we developed an analytical approach that combines global sensitivity analysis (GSA) with classification and regression trees (CART) and Random Forest, a bootstrapping CART method. We used GSA to quantify the interacting effects of the full range of uncertainty around all parameter estimates, Random Forest to rank parameters according to their total effect on model predictions, and CART to identify higher-order interactions. GSA simulations yielded a wide range of predictions, including annual germination frequency of -%, annual first-year survival frequency of -%, and patch occupancy of -%. This variance was explained primarily by complex interactions among abiotic parameters including capillary fringe height, stage-discharge relationship, and floodplain accretion rate, which interacted with biotic factors to affect survival. Model precision was primarily influenced by well-studied parameter estimates with minimal associated uncertainty and was virtually unaffected by parameter estimates for which there are no available empirical data and thus a large degree of uncertainty. Therefore, research to improve model predictions should not always focus on the least-studied parameters, but rather those to which model predictions are most sensitive. We advocate the combined use of global sensitivity analysis, CART, and Random Forest to: () prioritize research efforts by ranking variable importance; () efficiently improve models by focusing on the most important parameters; and () illuminate complex model properties including nonlinear interactions.

These quantities are treated as random variables and a variance-based GSA is performed in a numerical Monte Carlo framework.

The Sobol indices are adopted as sensitivity measures to provide an estimate of the role of uncertain parameters on the (ensemble) target moments. Calculation of the indices is performed by employing PCE as a surrogate model of the migration process to reduce the computational burden.

Concentration-time profiles of non-diffusive chemical kinetic processes and flame speed profiles of fuel-oxidiser mixtures can be described by certain characteristic points, so that relations between the coordinates of these points and the input parameters of chemical kinetic models become almost linear. This linear transformation model simplifies the analysis of chemical kinetic models, hence creating a robust global sensitivity analysis and allowing quick optimisation and reduction of these models. Firstly, in this study the model is extensively validated by the optimisation of a syngas combustion model with a large data set of imitated ignition experiments. The optimisation with the linear transformation model is quick and accurate, revealing the potential for decreasing the numerical costs of the optimisation process by at least one order of magnitude compared to established methods. Additionally, the optimisation on this data set demonstrates the capability of predicting reaction rate coefficients more accurately than by currently known confidence intervals. In a first application, methane combustion models are optimised with a small experimental set consisting of OH(A) and CH(A) concentration profiles from shock tube ignition experiments, species profiles from flow reactor experiments and laminar flame speeds. With the optimised models, especially the predictability for the flame speeds of mixtures of hydrogen, carbon monoxide and methane can be increased compared to established models.

We performed a global sensitivity analysis (GSA) on the benchmark simulation model No.  with the input uncertainty associated to the biokinetic parameters in the activated sludge model No.  (ASM), a fractionation parameter in the primary clarifier, and the settling parameters in the SST model. Based on the parameter sensitivity rankings obtained in this study, the settling parameters were found to be as influential as the biokinetic parameters on the uncertainty of WWTP model predictions, particularly for biogas production and treated water quality. However, the sensitivity measures were found to be dependent on the -D SST models selected. Accordingly, we suggest a different optimum parameter selection for the calibration of WWTP models when either of the -D SST models is used. Using first-order models, the calibration should give equal importance to the adjustment of the hindered settling and slow settling parameter values. The adjusted hindered settling parameters have, however, no physical meaning, and might additionally obtain unrealistic values. In contrast, using second-order SST models, the focus of calibration should be on providing measured values for the hindered settling parameters. This approach is in close agreement with the recommendations made in the good modelling practice protocol on activated sludge modelling.

We applied variance-based global sensitivity analysis for different atmospheric conditions and observation configurations. Among  input parameters, crown coverage, leaf area index, leaf inclination distribution function and soil moisture were found to be the most influential parameters driving the output variance of the radiance between  and  nm with a few exceptions. Hapke's soil parameters and the canopy layer dissociation factor were recognized to have marginal influence on the output radiance. It is also found that a large portion of uncertainty in the output radiance is driven by the interaction effects among input parameters in the visible (similar to  nm), whereas the red-near infrared (similar to  nm), seems to have fewer interaction effects. The effect of solar/view direction is found to be significant on TOA radiance sensitivity to the input parameters. The results also confirmed that the sensitivities of surface reflectance are comparable to the TOA radiance sensitivities when the atmosphere is clear and visibility is high. Since coupled surface-atmosphere RT models can be computationally intensive, this work also introduces an improvement to the design and sampling of screening methods for efficient sensitivity analysis of computationally expensive models.

Effective design and analysis must understand the sensitivity of model predictions to changes in model parameters, but global sensitivity analyses become increasingly challenging as the number of input parameters increases. Active subspaces are part of an emerging set of tools for discovering and exploiting low-dimensional structures in the map from high-dimensional inputs to model outputs. We extend linear and quadratic model-based heuristics for active subspace discovery to time-dependent processes and apply the resulting technique to a lithium ion battery model.

In general, most unknown inputs for the MCS are regarded as single probability distributions based on experts' subjective judgements and assumptions, when simulation information andmeasured data are inaccurate and insufficient. However, this can lead to meaningless and untrustworthy results, since the results are obtained using only single probability distributions without considering reducible possibilities of some unknown inputs. This paper introduces a fuzzy MCS for dealing with the aforementioned problems. In comparison with the MCS, the fuzzy MCS has the advantage of considering the aleatory and epistemic uncertainty, and can provide a family of probability distributions. This paper also discusses how fuzzy MCS could be effectively used for uncertainty and global sensitivity analysis.",,"Kim, YJ",SUSTAINABILITY,monte carlo simulation fuzzy monte carlo simulation uncertainty sensitivity building simulation,10.3390/su9040539

The underlying idea behind all SI algorithms is similar, and various SI algorithms differ only in their details. In this paper we discuss the algorithmic equivalence of particle swarm optimization (PSO) and various other newer SI algorithms, including the shuffled frog leaping algorithm (SFLA), the group search optimizer (GSO), the firefly algorithm (FA), artificial bee colony algorithm (ABC) and the gravitational search algorithm (GSA). We find that the original versions of SFLA, GSO, FA, ABC, and GSA, are all algorithmically identical to PSO under certain conditions. We discuss their diverse biological motivations and algorithmic details as typically implemented, and show how their differences enhance the diversity of SI research and application. Then we numerically compare SFLA, GSO, FA, ABC, and GSA, with basic and advanced versions on some continuous benchmark functions and combinatorial knapsack problems. Empirical results show that an advanced version of ABC performs best on the continuous benchmark functions, and advanced versions of SFLA and GSA perform best on the combinatorial knapsack problems.

Herein, a systematic framework for developing predictive models is presented comprising of model development, global sensitivity analysis, optimal experimental design for parameter estimation, and predictive capability checking. Its efficacy and validity are demonstrated using a fed-batch structured/unstructured model of antibody-secreting hybridoma cultures. Global sensitivity analysis is first used to identify sensitive model parameters (initial values estimated from batch cultures). Information-rich data from an optimally designed fed-batch experiment are then used to estimate these parameters, resulting in good agreement between simulation and experimental results. Finally, the model's predictive capability is confirmed by comparison with an independent set of fed-batch cultures.

Numerical optimization of fracture stimulation often requires a large number of evaluations of objective functions and constraints from forward hydraulic fracturing models, which are computationally expensive and even prohibitive in some situations. Moreover, there are a variety of uncertainties associated with the pre-existing fracture distributions and rock mechanical properties, which affect the optimized decisions for hydraulic fracturing. In this study, a surrogate-based approach is developed for efficient optimization of hydraulic fracturing well design in the presence of natural-system uncertainties. The fractal dimension is derived from the simulated fracturing network as the objective for maximizing energy recovery sweep efficiency. The surrogate model, which is constructed using training data from high-fidelity fracturing models for mapping the relationship between uncertain input parameters and the fractal dimension, provides fast approximation of the objective functions and constraints. A suite of surrogate models constructed using different fitting methods is evaluated and validated for fast predictions. Global sensitivity analysis is conducted to gain insights into the impact of the input variables on the output of interest, and further used for parameter screening. The high efficiency of the surrogate-based approach is demonstrated for three optimization scenarios with different and uncertain ambient conditions.

Quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) is employed by GUSA to obtain realizations of uncertain parameters, which are then input to the simulation model for analysis. Compared to GLUE, GUSA can not only evaluate global sensitivity and uncertainty of modeling parameter sets, but also quantify the uncertainty in modeling prediction sets. Moreover, GUSA's another advantage lies in alleviation of computational effort, since those globally-insensitive parameters can be identified and removed from the uncertain-parameter set. GUSA is applied to a practical petroleum-contaminated site in Canada to investigate free product migration and recovery processes under aquifer remediation operations. Results from global sensitivity analysis show that () initial free product thickness has the most significant impact on total recovery volume but least impact on residual free product thickness and recovery rate; () total recovery volume and recovery rate are sensitive to residual LNAPL phase saturations and soil porosity. Results from uncertainty predictions reveal that the residual thickness would remain high and almost unchanged after about half-year of skimmer-well scheme; the rather high residual thickness (.-. m  years later) indicates that natural attenuation would not be suitable for the remediation. The largest total recovery volume would be from water pumping, followed by vacuum pumping, and then skimmer.

Under the GSA, excessive customer demand superior to a bound is fulfilled by using operating flexibility measures such as expediting and overtime. In this paper, the GSA is used to optimize the (R, Q) policy for a continuous review serial inventory system with Poisson demand and fixed order costs at each stocking location. Except for inventory holding costs, we also consider fixed order costs and operating flexibility costs in the system. Firstly, a deterministic mathematical programming model that considers the effects of using operating flexibility measures on the physical flow and the total cost of the system is established for optimizing the inventory policy under a given cycle service level. The model is solved by using an iterative procedure. In each iteration of the procedure, the fill rate of the system is estimated, and two sub-problems of the model, the order size decision sub-problem and the reorder point decision sub-problem, are solved by using dynamic programming algorithms for a given fill rate. With this procedure, the original optimization problem is solved by finding the optimal cycle service level of the system using a line search.

Such computer codes are a function of uncertain input parameters and a global sensitivity analysis (GSA) can be performed to identify their impacts on the simulator outputs. Sobol' indices, based on output variance decomposition, are commonly used to perform quantitative GSA. For many years now, other tools have been studied, closer to physical practices such as the derivative-based global sensitivity measures (DGSM). However, numerical simulators rarely provide the output gradient and DGSM estimation is not directly possible. To address this limitation, we propose to estimate the DGSMs using a Gaussian process metamodel (GPM) which approximates the simulator. Based on this GPM, we propose two DGSM estimators: a plug-in one defined by the DGSM of the GPM predictor and another one defined by the expectation of the DGSM associated to the full-GPM. The latter is equal to the first one completed by a variance term and can be accompanied by a credibility interval. For Gaussian kernel and uniform input laws, analytical formulas are given for both DGSM estimators. For all other situations, Monte Carlo methods for the expectation approximations are proposed: a propagative version of the Gibbs sampler and a chi-square approximation. Moreover, a significance test for the full-GPM based estimator is proposed for screening. The convergence of the two GPM-based DGSM estimators and the Monte Carlo approaches is compared in analytical test cases.

These analyses revealed down-regulated gene sets related to calcium channels and ion transport, g-proteins, and olfactory receptors.

The FP project, ValuefromUrine, proposed a new two-step process (called VFU) based on struvite precipitation and microbial electrolysis cell (MEC) to recover ammonia, which is further transformed into ammonium sulphate. The environmental and economic impacts of its prospective implementation in the Netherlands were evaluated based on life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology and operational costs. In order to tackle the lack of stable data from the pilot plant and the complex effects on wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), process simulation was coupled with LCA and costs assessment using the Python programming language. Additionally, particular attention was given to the propagation and analysis of inputs uncertainties. Five scenarios of VFU implementation were compared to the conventional treatment of  m() of wastewater. Inventory data were obtained from SUMO software for the WWTP operation. LCA was based on Brightway software (using ecoinvent database and ReCiPe method). The results, based on  iterations sampled from inputs distributions (foreground parameters, ecoinvent background data and market prices), showed a significant advantage of VFU technology, both at a small and decentralized scale and at a large and centralized scale (% confidence intervals not including zero values). The benefits mainly concern the production of fertilizers, the decreased efforts at the WWTP, the water savings from toilets flushing, as well as the lower infrastructure volumes if the WWTP is redesigned (in case of significant reduction of nutrients load in wastewater). The modelling approach, which could be applied to other case studies, improves the representativeness and the interpretation of results (e.g. complex relationships, global sensitivity analysis) but requires additional efforts (computing and engineering knowledge, longer calculation time). Finally, the sustainability assessment should be refined in the future with the development of the technology at larger scale to update these preliminary conclusions before its commercialization.

In a case study for the arid zone of Chile, a detailed water balance was calculated using a coupled surface-subsurface hydrological model (HydroGeoSphere). In a first step, the model was parameterized with detailed runoff and soil water content data collected during simulated rainfall to calibrate surface and subsurface flow processes simultaneously, using six responsive parameters identified by a global sensitivity analysis. The calibrated model accurately reproduced observed soil moisture contents (R- = .) and runoff amounts (R- = .), and represented the overflowing infiltration trench, which is a clear improvement over existing frameworks that do not consider surface-subsurface flow interactions. A comparative analysis with a natural slope demonstrated that the trench was efficient in capturing runoff under high rainfall intensities, such as the one simulated, resulting in a significant decrease (%) of runoff. In the final section, a detailed water balance of the trench was calculated for four characteristic years with increasing precipitation. Significant differences in the water balance components were only observed for the very wet year (with a return period of  yr), where % of the potential runoff was effectively harvested and stored in the soil profile.

We perform GSA by calculating the Sobol indices, which provide a variance-based importance measure of the effects of uncertain parameters on the output of a chosen interpretive transport model. The choice of PCE has the following two benefits: () it provides the global sensitivity indices in a straightforward manner, and () PCE can serve as a surrogate model for the calibration of parameters. The coefficients of the PCE are computed by probabilistic collocation. The methodology is applied to two nonreactive transport experiments available in the literature, while considering both transient and pseudo steady state transport regimes. This method allows a rigorous investigation of the relative effects and importance of different uncertain quantities, which include boundary conditions as well as porous medium hydraulic and dispersive parameters. The parameters that are most relevant to depicting the system's behavior can then be evaluated. In addition, one can assess the space-time distribution of measurement points, which is the most influential factor for the identifiability of parameters.

In this study, a global sensitivity analysis method is proposed that is suitable and effective for multivariable and nonlinear systems. Specifically, sensitivity is defined before nonlinear multipolynomial expansion is conducted according to the Taylor midvalue theorem to intuitively determine nonlinear relationships between the rate of change in the dependent variable and each independent variable. A back-propagation network is also used to determine these relationships. The detailed computational steps and methods for evaluating the results are provided. The proposed method was tested using computer simulation and with an actual hydrological engineering problem. Computer simulations aided the design of experimental plans directed at linear and nonlinear polynomials. The experimental results showed that sensitivity analysis of dependent variables and each independent variable depends on two main characteristics: () the relation mapped between dependent variables and each independent variable, and () the value of each independent variable. The randomness of the sample, the structure of the back-propagation network, and the parameters did not significantly affect the final sensitivity calculation results. Analysis of the hydrological engineering problem showed that, given antecedent runoff and precipitation, the main factor that affected runoff in the Nenjiang River basin during flood season was antecedent precipitation whereas antecedent runoff was the main factor in the nonflood season. These results were reasonable and consistent with hydrological laws. Based on theoretical experiments and an actual engineering example, this preliminary study demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of this method of global sensitivity analysis in addressing complex problems.", (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.,"Li, HY|Tian, Q|Wang, XJ|Wu, YN",JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGIC ENGINEERING,global sensitivity analysis nonlinear back propagation network relation mapping computer simulation runoff,10.1061/(ASCE)HE.1943-5584.0001131

This technology divides the huge bandwidth of an optical fiber into different wavelengths, providing different available channels per link of fiber. However, when it is necessary to establish a set of demands, a problem comes up. This problem is known as a routing and wavelength assignment (RWA) problem. Depending on the traffic pattern, two varieties of a RWA problem have been considered in the literature: static and dynamic. In this paper, we present a comparative study among three multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) based on swarm intelligence to solve the RWA problem in real-world optical networks. Artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm, gravitational search algorithm (GSA), and firefly algorithm (FA) are the selected evolutionary algorithms, but are adapted to multiobjective domain (MO-ABC, MO-GSA, and MO-FA, respectively). In order to prove the goodness of the swarm proposals, we have compared them with a standard MOEA: fast nondominated sorting genetic algorithm. Finally, we present a comparison among the metaheuristics based on swarm intelligence and several techniques published in the literature, coming to the conclusion that swarm intelligence is very suitable to solve the RWA problem, and presumably that it may obtain such quality results not only in diverse telecommunication optimization problems, but also in other engineering optimization problems.",,"Rubio-Largo, A|Vega-Rodriguez, MA|Gomez-Pulido, JA|Sanchez-Perez, JM",IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS MAN AND CYBERNETICS PART C-APPLICATIONS AND REVIEWS,multiobjective optimization routing and wavelength assignment (rwa) problem swarm intelligence wavelength division multiplexing (wdm) optical networks,10.1109/TSMCC.2012.2212704

Several works have established the need of integrating the LCA and risk analysis methodologies, due to the several common aspects. One of the ways to reach such integration is through guaranteeing that uncertainties in LCA modeling are carefully treated. It has been claimed that more attention should be paid to quantifying the uncertainties present in the various phases of LCA. Though the topic has been attracting increasing attention of practitioners and experts in LCA, there is still a lack of understanding and a limited use of the available statistical tools. In this work, we introduce a protocol to conduct global sensitivity analysis in LCA.

When x (), x (), . . . , x (n) are independent variables, the HDMR component functions are uniquely defined under a specific so called vanishing condition. A new formulation for the HDMR component functions is presented including cases when x contains correlated variables. Under a relaxed vanishing condition, a general formulation for the component functions is derived providing a unique HDMR decomposition of f (x) for independent and/or correlated variables. The component functions with independent variables are special limiting cases of the general formulation. A novel numerical method is developed to efficiently and accurately determine the component functions.

This study investigates the use of global sensitivity analysis as a screening tool to reduce the parametric dimensionality of multi-objective hydrological model calibration problems while maximizing the information extracted from hydrological response data. This study shows that by expanding calibration problem formulations beyond traditional, statistical error metrics to also include metrics that capture indices or signatures of hydrological function, it is possible to reduce the complexity of calibration while maintaining high quality model predictions. The sensitivity-guided calibration is demonstrated using the Sacramento Soil Moisture Accounting (SAC-SMA) conceptual rainfall-runoff model of moderate complexity (i.e., up to  freely varying parameters). Using both statistical and hydrological metrics, optimization results demonstrate that parameters controlling at least % of the model output variance (through individual effects and interactions) should be included in the calibration process. This threshold generally yields -% reductions in the number of SAC-SMA parameters requiring calibration - setting the others to a priori values - while maintaining high quality predictions. Two parameters are recommended to be calibrated in all cases (percent impervious area and lower zone tension water storage), three parameters are needed in drier watersheds (additional impervious area, riparian zone vegetation, and percent of percolation going to tension storage), and the lower zone parameters are crucial unless the watershed is very dry. Overall, this study demonstrates that a coupled, multi-objective sensitivity and calibration analysis better captures differences between watersheds during model calibration and serves to maximize the value of available watershed response time series. These contributions are particularly important given the ongoing development of more complex integrated models, which will require new tools to address the growing discrepancy between the information content of hydrological data and the number of model parameters that have to be estimated.

In particular, more efficient and robust ways to obtain a solid understanding of how the sensitivity to each parameter depends on the values of the other parameters are sorely needed. We report a new methodology for global sensitivity analysis based on Hierarchical Cluster-based Partial Least Squares Regression (HC-PLSR)-based approximations (metamodelling) of the input-output mappings of dynamic models, which we expect to be generic, efficient and robust, even for systems with highly nonlinear input-output relationships. The two-step HC-PLSR metamodelling automatically separates the observations (here corresponding to different combinations of input parameter values) into groups based on the dynamic model behaviour, then analyses each group separately with Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR). This produces one global regression model comprising all observations, as well as regional regression models within each group, where the regression coefficients can be used as sensitivity measures. Thereby a more accurate description of complex interactions between inputs to the dynamic model can be revealed through analysis of how a certain level of one input parameter affects the model sensitivity to other inputs. We illustrate the usefulness of the HC-PLSR approach on a dynamic model of a mouse heart muscle cell, and demonstrate how it reveals interaction patterns of probable biological significance not easily identifiable by a global regression-based sensitivity analysis alone. Applied for sensitivity analysis of a complex, high-dimensional dynamic model of the mouse heart muscle cell, several interactions between input parameters were identified by the two-step HC-PLSR analysis that could not be detected in the single-step global analysis. Hence, our approach has the potential to reveal new biological insight through the identification of complex parameter interaction patterns. The HC-PLSR metamodel complexity can be adjusted according to the nonlinear complexity of the input-output mapping of the analysed dynamic model through adjustment of the number of regional regression models included. This facilitates sensitivity analysis of dynamic models of varying complexities.", (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

However, building a high-fidelity model, particularly at large scales, remains a challenging task, due to complexities in model functioning and behaviour and uncertainties in model structure, parameterization, and data. Global sensitivity analysis (GSA), which characterizes how the variation in the model response is attributed to variations in its input factors (e.g., parameters and forcing data), provides an opportunity to enhance the development and application of these complex models. In this paper, we advocate using GSA as an integral part of the modelling process by discussing its capabilities as a tool for diagnosing model structure and detecting potential defects, identifying influential factors, characterizing uncertainty, and selecting calibration parameters. Accordingly, we conduct a comprehensive GSA of a complex land surface-hydrology model, Modelisation Environmentale-Surface et Hydrologie (MESH), which combines the Canadian land surface scheme with a hydrological routing component, WATROUTE. Various GSA experiments are carried out using a new technique, called Variogram Analysis of Response Surfaces, for alternative hydroclimatic conditions in Canada using multiple criteria, various model configurations, and a full set of model parameters. Results from this study reveal that, in addition to different hydroclimatic conditions and SA criteria, model configurations can also have a major impact on the assessment of sensitivity. GSA can identify aspects of the model internal functioning that are counter-intuitive and thus help the modeller to diagnose possible model deficiencies and make recommendations for improving development and application of the model. As a specific outcome of this work, a list of the most influential parameters for the MESH model is developed. This list, along with some specific recommendations, is expected to assist the wide community of MESH and Canadian land surface scheme users, to enhance their modelling applications.",,"Haghnegahdar, A|Razavi, S|Yassin, F|Wheater, H",HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,class hydrological modelling land surface modelling mesh model calibration model diagnostics sensitivity analysis uncertainty analysis vars,10.1002/hyp.11358

Integrating LID into residential subdivisions and increasing population density by building more compact living spaces (e.g., apartment homes) can result in a more sustainable city by reducing stormwater runoff, saving infrastructural cost, increasing the number of affordable homes, and supporting public transportation. We develop an agent-based model (ABM) that describes the interactions between several decision-makers (i.e., local government, a developer, and homebuyers) and fiscal drivers (e.g., property taxes, impact fees). The model simulates the development of nine square miles of greenfield land. A more sustainable development (MSD) scenario introduces an impact fee that developers must pay if they choose not to use LID to build houses or apartment homes. Model simulations show homeowners selecting apartment homes % or % of the time after  years of development in MSD or business as usual (BAU) scenarios, respectively. The increased adoption of apartment homes results from the lower cost of using LID and improved quality of life for apartment homes relative to single-family homes. The MSD scenario generates more tax revenue and water savings than does BAU. A time-dependent global sensitivity analysis quantifies the importance of socioeconomic variables on the adoption rate of apartment homes. The top influential factors are the annual pay rates (or capital recovery factor) for single-family houses and apartment homes. The ABM can be used by city managers and policymakers for scenario exploration in accordance with local conditions to evaluate the effectiveness of impact fees and other policies in promoting LID and compact growth.",,"Lu, ZM|Noonan, D|Crittenden, J|Jeong, H|Wang, DL",ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY,,10.1021/es304924w

Error correction is a form of data assimilation used to improve streamflow forecasts. The dual-pass method is ideally suited for catchments with long-lasting shifts in runoff efficiency that the hydrologic model poorly simulates. In a first pass, the simulation is rescaled (i.e. multiplicative correction is applied), based on the cumulative error over the prior  days. In a second pass, a correction is added to the adjusted series, based on the error from the most recent timestep. When tested on  Australian and  United States catchments, the dual-pass approach improved the median four-measure validation skill score from . to . for the GRJ model and from . to . for a naive coefficient model. The majority of improvement comes from the second pass (the short-memory component). The magnitudes of correction at each pass are controlled by two tuneable parameters: a global sensitivity analysis determined that satisfactory performance could be had without tuning of the long-memory (first pass) error-correction parameter. For most catchments, the use of the long-memory error-correction neither degrades nor significantly improves performance. International hydrological modeling datasets have relatively fewer catchments with slowly varying errors than might be encountered in operational forecasting environments, therefore, there is a need for better identification and study of such problem catchments.", Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Secondly, a chaotic mutation operator is embedded into GSA and a selection-operator-based greedy rule is adopted to update population. When dealing with the constraints of the SEEHTS, a modification strategy by dividing the violation water volume into several parts and randomly selecting intervals to adjust the water discharge gradually is proposed to handle the water dynamic balance constraints. Meanwhile, a new symmetrical adjusting strategy is adopted to handle reservoir storage constraints. Furthermore, the priority index strategy based on thermal power output is applied to handle system load balance constraints. To test the performance of the proposed method, simulation results have been compared with those obtained by particle swarm optimization, evolutionary programming and differential evolution reported in literature.

Therefore, in the last decade the use of machine learning has spread rapidly throughout computer science and beyond. This approach, supported on advanced statistics analysis, is usually known as Data Mining (DM) and has been applied successfully in different knowledge domains. In the present study, we show that DM can make a great contribution in solving complex problems in civil engineering, namely in the field of geotechnical engineering. Particularly, the high learning capabilities of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) algorithm, characterized by it flexibility and non-linear capabilities, were applied in the prediction of the Uniaxial Compressive Strength (UCS) of Jet Grouting (JG) samples directly extracted from JG columns, usually known as soilcrete.

However, even after many years of experience still lacks of accurate methods for JG columns design. Accordingly, in the present paper a novel approach (based on SVM algorithm) for UCS prediction of soilcrete mixtures is proposed supported on  results collected from different geotechnical works. Furthermore, a global sensitivity analysis is applied in order to explain and extract understandable knowledge from the proposed model.

A global sensitivity analysis is conducted to investigate the sensitivity of VART DO-L model input parameters. Results of the sensitivity analysis indicate that the most sensitive parameter is the relative size of the advection-dominated storage zones (A(s)/A), followed by a lumped reaction term (R) for the flocculent layer, biological reaction rate ((o)) in diffusive layer and biochemical oxygen demand concentration (L) in water column. In order to address uncertainty in model input parameters, Monte Carlo simulations are performed to sample parameter values and to produce various parameter combinations or cases. The VART DO-L model is applied to the Lower Amite River in Louisiana, USA, to simulate vertical and longitudinal variations in DO under the cases. In terms of longitudinal variation, the DO level decreases from .mgl at the Denham Springs station to about .mgl(-) at the Port Vincent station. In terms of vertical variation, the DO level drops rapidly from the overlying water column to the advection-dominated storage zone and further to the diffusive layer. The DO level (C-F) in the advective layer (flocculent layer) can reach as high as % of DO concentration (C) in the water column. The VART DO-L model may be applied to similar rivers for simulation of spatial variations in DO level."," Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Zahraeifard, V|Deng, ZQ|Malone, R",HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,dissolved oxygen sediment oxygen demand triple-layer model vertical variation longitudinal variation,10.1002/hyp.10144

Once optimal values are estimated, parameter uncertainty is computed through the covariance matrix. However, alternative approaches based on the consideration of the model parameters as probability distributions (i.e. Bayesian inference), may be of interest. The aim of this work is to apply (and compare) both Bayesian and frequentist inference methods when assessing uncertainty for an ASM-type model, which considers intracellular storage and biomass growth, simultaneously. Practical identifiability was addressed exclusively considering respirometric profiles based on the oxygen uptake rate and with the aid of probabilistic global sensitivity analysis. Parameter uncertainty was thus estimated according to both the Bayesian and frequentist inferential procedures. Results were compared in order to evidence the strengths and weaknesses of both approaches. Since it was demonstrated that Bayesian inference could be reduced to a frequentist approach under particular hypotheses, the former can be considered as a more generalist methodology. Hence, the use of Bayesian inference is encouraged for tackling inferential issues in ASM environments.",,"Zonta, ZJ|Flotats, X|Magri, A",ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY,markov chain monte carlo parameter uncertainty hessian activated sludge model bayesian,10.1080/09593330.2013.876450

One effective way to mitigate flood risk lies in implementing a real-time forecast and warning system based on a rainfall-runoff model. This study used a semiarid, physics-based, and spatially distributed watershed model driven by high-resolution radar rainfall input to evaluate such a system. The predictive utility of the model and dominant sources of uncertainty were investigated for several runoff events within the U. S. Department of Agriculture Agricultural Research Service Walnut Gulch Experimental Watershed located in the southwestern United States. Sources of uncertainty considered were rainfall estimates, watershed model parameters, and initial soil moisture conditions. Results derived through a variance-based comprehensive global sensitivity analysis indicated that the high predictive uncertainty in the modeled response was heavily dominated by biases in the radar rainfall depth estimates. Key model parameters and initial model states were identified, and we generally found that modeled hillslope characteristics are more influential than channel characteristics in small semiarid basins. We also observed an inconsistency in the parameter sets identified as behavioral for different events, which suggests that model calibration to historical data is unlikely to consistently improve predictive performance for different events and that real-time parameter updating may be preferable.",,"Yatheendradas, S|Wagener, T|Gupta, H|Unkrich, C|Goodrich, D|Schaffner, M|Stewart, A",WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,,10.1029/2007WR005940

In the elementary effect method, a strategy for considering the dependencies, that result from a set of constraints between different parameters, is proposed. Moreover, because the numerical implementation of variance-based sensitivity estimates, in particular, has been proven to require intensive evaluations of the system under investigation, a practical surrogate modeling technique is utilized. This technique is based on quadratic polynomial regression and represents a reliable approximation of the computationally expensive mechanized tunnel simulation.

However, one often cannot afford the computational costs of sampling-based approaches in combination with expensive high-fidelity forward models. Reduced-order models (ROM) can substantially accelerate calculation of these sensitivities. However, it is usually difficult to determine what type of ROM should be used and how accurately the ROM represents the high-fidelity model (HFM) results. In this paper, we propose to concurrently use multiple ROMs as a way to assess the robustness of the model-reduction method. Two sets of HFM simulations are needed, one set for building ROMs and the other for validating ROMs. Our goal is to keep the total number of HFM simulations to a minimum. Ideally some of the HFM simulations in the first set can be shared by different ROMs. Based on validation results, the ROMs can be combined with different schemes. We demonstrate that we can achieve the goal by using four different ROMs and still considerably save computational time compared to using traditional HFM simulation for calculating sensitivity indices. We apply the approach to an example problem of a large-scale geological carbon dioxide storage system, in which the objective is to calculate a sensitivity index to identify important parameters. For this problem, the locally best ROM provides better estimates than the weighted average from all ROMs. (C) ", Elsevier Ltd.

One of the main concerns about GCS is the risk of CO escape from the storage formation through leakage pathways in the sealing layer. This study aims at understanding the main sources of uncertainty affecting the upward migration of CO through pre-existing ""passive"" wells and the risk of fissuring of target formation during GCS operations, which may create pathways for CO escape. The analysis focuses on a potential GCS site located within the Michigan Basin, a geologic basin situated on the lower Peninsula of the state of Michigan. For this purpose, we perform a stochastic analysis (SA) and a global sensitivity analysis (GSA) to investigate the influence of uncertain parameters, such as: permeability and porosity of the injection formation, passive well permeability, system compressibility, brine residual saturation, and CO end-point relative permeability. For the GSA, we apply the extended Fourier amplitude sensitivity test (FAST), which can rank parameters based on their direct impact on the output, or first-order effect, and capture the interaction effect of one parameter with the others, or higher-order effect. To simulate GCS, we use an efficient semi-analytical multiphase flow model, which makes the application of the SA and the GSA computationally affordable. Results show that, among model parameters, the most influential on both fluid overpressure and CO mass leakage is the injection formation permeability. Brine residual saturation also has a significant impact on fluid overpressure. While influence of permeability on fluid overpressure is mostly first-order, brine residual saturation's influence is mostly higher-order. CO mass leakage is also affected by passive well permeability, followed by porosity and system compressibility through higher-order effects. (C) ", Elsevier Ltd.

The methods entail global sensitivity analysis for retaining important PDD component functions, and a full- or sparse-grid dimension-reduction integration or quasi Monte Carlo simulation for estimating the PDD expansion coefficients. A unified algorithm, endowed with two distinct ranking schemes for grading component functions, was created for their numerical implementation. The fully adaptive-sparse PDD method is comprehensive and rigorous, leading to the second-moment statistics of a stochastic response that converges to the exact solution when the tolerances vanish. A partially adaptive-sparse PDD method, obtained through regulated adaptivity and sparsity, is economical and is, therefore, expected to solve practical problems with numerous variables. Compared with past developments, the adaptive-sparse PDD methods do not require their truncation parameter(s) to be assigned a priori or arbitrarily. The numerical results reveal that an adaptive-sparse PDD method achieves a desired level of accuracy with considerably fewer coefficients compared with existing PDD approximations. For a required accuracy in calculating the probabilistic response characteristics, the new bivariate adaptive-sparse PDD method is more efficient than the existing bivariately truncated PDD method by almost an order of magnitude.

GSA allows establishing a ranking among the input parameters, according to their influence on the variability of the output. Such feature is of high interest in particular when aiming at defining parameterized LCA models. When performing a GSA, the description of the variability of each input parameter may affect the results. This aspect is critical when studying new products or emerging technologies, where data regarding the model inputs are very uncertain and may cause misleading GSA outcomes, such as inappropriate input rankings. A systematic assessment of this sensitivity issue is now proposed. We develop a methodology to analyze the sensitivity of the GSA results (i.e. the stability of the ranking of the inputs) with respect to the description of such inputs of the model (i.e. the definition of their inherent variability). With this research, we aim at enriching the debate on the application of GSA to LCAs affected by high uncertainties. We illustrate its application with a case study, aiming at the elaboration of a simple model expressing the life cycle greenhouse gas emissions of enhanced geothermal systems (EGS) as a function of few key parameters.

Understanding the relative importance of such sources of uncertainty is essential to support model calibration, validation and diagnostic evaluation and to prioritize efforts for uncertainty reduction. It can also support the identification of 'disinformative data' whose values are the consequence of measurement errors or inadequate observations. Sensitivity analysis (SA) provides the theoretical framework and the numerical tools to quantify the relative contribution of different sources of uncertainty to the variability of the model outputs. In traditional applications of global SA (GSA), model outputs are aggregations of the full set of a simulated variable. For example, many GSA applications use a performance metric (e.g. the root mean squared error) as model output that aggregates the distances of a simulated time series to available observations. This aggregation of propagated uncertainties prior to GSA may lead to a significant loss of information and may cover up local behaviour that could be of great interest. Time-varying sensitivity analysis (TVSA), where the aggregation and SA are repeated at different time steps, is a viable option to reduce this loss of information. In this work, we use TVSA to address two questions: () Can we distinguish between the relative importance of parameter uncertainty versus data uncertainty in time? () Do these influences change in catchments with different characteristics? To our knowledge, the results present one of the first quantitative investigations on the relative importance of parameter and data uncertainty across time. We find that the approach is capable of separating influential periods across data and parameter uncertainties, while also highlighting significant differences between the catchments analysed.", Copyright (C) 2016 The Authors.

The process-based models, which estimate nitrogen dynamics under irrigation, are widely used to investigate the best irrigation and fertilization management practices in developed and developing countries. However, for modeling such a complex system for wastewater reuse, it is critical to conduct a sensitivity analysis to determine numerous input parameters and their interactions that contribute most to the variance of the model output for the development of process-based model. In this study, application of a comprehensive global sensitivity analysis for nitrogen dynamics was reported. The objective was to compare different global sensitivity analysis (GSA) on the key parameters for different model predictions of nitrogen and crop growth modules. The analysis was performed as two steps. Firstly, Morris screening method, which is one of the most commonly used screening method, was carried out to select the top affected parameters; then, a variance-based global sensitivity analysis method (extended Fourier amplitude sensitivity test, EFAST) was used to investigate more thoroughly the effects of selected parameters on model predictions. The results of GSA showed that strong parameter interactions exist in crop nitrogen uptake, nitrogen denitrification, crop yield, and evapotranspiration modules. Among all parameters, one of the soil physical-related parameters named as the van Genuchten air entry parameter showed the largest sensitivity effects on major model predictions. These results verified that more effort should be focused on quantifying soil parameters for more accurate model predictions in nitrogen- and crop-related predictions, and stress the need to better calibrate the model in a global sense.

The study area is located in a maritime climate with a mean annual air temperature of +. degrees C and about  mill of precipitation per year at sea level. The muitilayer feed-forward network is designed to make use of the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm to increase the speed of computation (convergence). Using climate data recorded at an automatic weather station nearby its well its water level records measured simultaneously, the ANN model was trained and verified using independent training and validation datasets. Parameters and the corresponding time lags were determined by statistical methods such its partial, cross- and autocorrelation. The results of the simulation confirm that the proposed model was able to identify the underlying non-linear relationships between the input parameters and the observed discharge. The correlation during validation shows it significant correlation coefficient of ., and an RMSE of . in respectively. However, it is almost impossible to decipher the internal behaviour of ANN due to its black-box character. Nevertheless, valuable insights were gained in the complex input-output relationships, and the occurrence of dependencies between different input variables were detected using global sensitivity analysis (GSA). The results of the GSA were compared with those of multiple linear regression (MLR). While the performance of the ANN is much better than the MLR, both models return similar results in terms of the dependency of the discharge upon input variables. It was found that despite the large proportion of glaciated surface area within the catchment, discharge is mainly controlled by precipitation (%). Furthermore, the runoff is slightly influenced by temperature (), global radiation (%) and wind speed (%).

However, the conventional global sensitivity indices are defined with consideration of only parametric uncertainty. Based on a hierarchical structure of parameter, model, and scenario uncertainties and on recently developed techniques of model- and scenario-averaging, this study derives new global sensitivity indices for multiple models and multiple scenarios. To reduce computational cost of variance-based global sensitivity analysis, sparse grid collocation method is used to evaluate the mean and variance terms involved in the variance-based global sensitivity analysis. In a simple synthetic case of groundwater flow and reactive transport, it is demonstrated that the global sensitivity indices vary substantially between the four models and three scenarios. Not considering the model and scenario uncertainties, might result in biased identification of important model parameters. This problem is resolved by using the new indices defined for multiple models and/or multiple scenarios. This is particularly true when the sensitivity indices and model/scenario probabilities vary substantially.

However, the uncertainties associated with MCDA techniques are inevitable and model outcomes are open to multiple types of uncertainty. In this paper, we present a systematic approach to uncertainty and sensitivity analysis. We access the uncertainty of landslide susceptibility maps produced with GIS-MCDA techniques. A new spatially-explicit approach and Dempster-Shafer Theory (DST) are employed to assess the uncertainties associated with two MCDA techniques, namely Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP) and Ordered Weighted Averaging (OWA) implemented in GIS. The methodology is composed of three different phases. First, weights are computed to express the relative importance of factors (criteria) for landslide susceptibility. Next, the uncertainty and sensitivity of landslide susceptibility is analyzed as a function of weights using Monte Carlo Simulation and Global Sensitivity Analysis. Finally, the results are validated using a landslide inventory database and by applying DST. The comparisons of the obtained landslide susceptibility maps of both MCDA techniques with known landslides show that the AHP outperforms OWA. However, the OWA-generated landslide susceptibility map shows lower uncertainty than the AHP-generated map. The results demonstrate that further improvement in the accuracy of GIS-based MCDA can be achieved by employing an integrated uncertainty-sensitivity analysis approach, in which the uncertainty of landslide susceptibility model is decomposed and attributed to model's criteria weights.

The investigation approach involved field sampling and collection of  sandstone samples from different outcrop locations, followed by laboratory studies such as grain-size analysis (GSA), constant head permeameter test and geochemical analysis of major and trace elements using X-ray fluorescence method. GSA and textural studies show that the sandstones range from fine to medium sands, constituting about < -% sand fraction, with graphic mean grain size of .-. mm. Other parameters such as coefficient of uniformity (C (u)) range from . to . (av. .), while standard deviation (sorting) values of .A similar to-.A similar to imply moderately well sorted materials.

A set of design variables is considered as random variables, and the mean mass is minimized for a given set of constraints - including the probability of failure by divergence or flutter. The optimization process requires repeated evaluation of reliability, which is a major contributor to the total computational cost. To reduce this cost, a polynomial chaos expansion (PCE)-based metamodel is created over a grid in the parameter space. These precomputed PCEs are then interpolated for reliability calculation at intermediate points in the parameter space, as demanded by the optimization algorithm. Two new modifications are made to this method in this work. First, the Gauss quadrature rule is used - instead of statistical simulation - to estimate the chaos coefficients for higher computational speed. Second, to increase this computational gain further, a non-uniform grid is chosen instead of a uniform one, based on relative importance of the design parameters. This relative importance is found from a global sensitivity analysis. This new modified method is applied on a rectangular unswept cantilever wing model.

These codes can be time consuming and depend on many uncertain variables related to radionuclide, release or weather conditions. These variables are of different kind: scalar, functional and qualitative. Given the uncertain parameters, code provides spatial maps of radionuclide concentration for various moments. The objective is to assess how these uncertainties can affect the code predictions and to perform a global sensitivity analysis of code in order to identify the most influential uncertain parameters. This sensitivity analysis often calls for the estimation of variance-based importance measures, called Sobol' indices. To estimate these indices, we propose a global methodology combining several advanced statistical techniques which enable to deal with the various natures of the uncertain inputs and the high dimension of model outputs. First, a quantification of input uncertainties is made based on data analysis and expert judgment. Then, an initial realistic sampling design is generated and the corresponding code simulations are performed. Based on this sample, a proper orthogonal decomposition of the spatial output is used and the main decomposition coefficients are modeled with Gaussian process surrogate model. The obtained spatial metamodel is then used to compute spatial maps of Sobol' indices, yielding the identification of global and local influence of each input variable and the detection of areas with interactions.

Developing simulation models to evaluate the impact of watershed nutrient loads on the reservoir's water quality is an essential step in eutrophication management. In this regard, analysis of model uncertainty gives an opportunity to assess the reliability and the margin of safety of the model predictions for Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) from the watershed nutrient load. In this study, a computational procedure has been proposed for the analysis of the model uncertainties in simulation of watershed phosphorous load and reservoir phosphorous concentration. Data from the Aharchai watershed which is located upstream of the Satarkhan reservoir in the northwestern part of Iran, is used as the study area to test the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. The Soil and Water Assessment Tools (SWAT) is utilized for assessment of watershed phosphorus load as the main agent resulting in the reservoir eutrophication in the region. The most effective parameters in model performance are identified by a global sensitivity analysis technique named modified Fourier Amplitude Sensitivity Test (FAST) which can incorporate parameter interdependencies. The Generalized Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation (GLUE) technique is also applied to set up behavioral ranges of the parameters that are relevant to the actual observations. Finally, the cumulative weighted-likelihood distribution functions (CWLDF) are derived for outputs of the SWAT. They are used jointly for estimation of results uncertainty limits using the Copula method. To assess the effectiveness of applying Best Management Practices (BMPs) in the watershed, two scenarios of with and without BMPs application are tested.

Secondly, heuristic search strategies are used to handle minimum up/down time constraints and decommit excess spinning reserve units. Thirdly, local mutation strategies are raised to avoid premature convergence of the algorithm and prevent it from trapping into local optima.

Addressing the influence of each of them on the final result and providing a ranking procedure may be useful for risk management purposes. This can be performed by a variance-based global sensitivity analysis. Nevertheless, such an analysis requires a large number of computer code simulations, which appears impracticable for computationally demanding simulations, with computation times ranging from several hours to several days. To overcome this difficulty, we propose a ""meta-model""-based strategy consisting in replacing the complex simulator by a ""statistical approximation"" provided by a Gaussian-process (GP) model. This allows computation of sensitivity measures from a limited number of simulations. For illustrative purposes, the proposed methodology is used to rank in terms of importance the properties of the elastoplastic model describing the complex behavior of the slip surface in the La Frasse landslide (Switzerland). One limitation of the GP-based methodology is that the computation of sensitivity measures is associated with uncertainty as the simulator is approximated using a training sample of small size, i.e., a limited knowledge on the ""true"" simulator. This source of uncertainty can be taken into account by treating the GP model from a Bayesian perspective. This provides the full posterior probability distribution associated with the sensitivity measures, which can be summarized by a confidence interval to outline the regions where the GP model is ""unsure.""

The scenario studied is that of a complex street canyon in the city of York, UK. The sensitivity of the turbulence and mean flow fields to the input parameters is detailed both at specific measurement points and in the associated canyon cross-section to aid comparison with field data. This analysis gives insight into how model parameters can influence the predicted outputs. It also shows the relative strength of each parameter in its influence. Four main input parameters are addressed. Three parameters are surface roughness lengths, determining the flow over a surface, and the fourth is the background wind direction. In order to determine the relative importance of each parameter, sensitivity indices are calculated for the canyon cross-section. The sensitivity of the flow structures in and above the canyon to each parameter is found to be very location dependant. In general, at a particular measurement point, it is the closest wall surface that is most influential on the model output. However, due to the complexity of the flow at different wind angles this is not always the case, for example when a recirculating canyon flow pattern is present. The background wind direction is shown to be an important parameter as it determines the surface features encountered by the flow. The accuracy with which this is specified when modelling a full-scale situation is therefore an important consideration when considering model uncertainty. Overall, the uncertainty due to roughness lengths is small in comparison to the mean outputs, indicating that the model is well defined even with large ranges of input parameter uncertainty.

The combined approach is applied to the modelling of the River Hodder catchment in North-West England. The top-down DBM model provides a well identified, statistically sound yet physically meaningful description of the rainfall-flow data, revealing important characteristics of the catchment-scale response, such as the nature of the effective rainfall nonlinearity and the partitioning of the effective rainfall into different flow pathways. These characteristics are defined inductively from the data without prior assumptions about the model structure, other than it is within the generic class of nonlinear differential-delay equations. The bottom-up modelling is developed using the TOPMODEL, whose structure is assumed a priori and is evaluated by global sensitivity analysis (GSA) in order to specify the most sensitive and important parameters. The subsequent exercises in calibration and validation, performed with Generalized Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation (GLUE), are carried out in the light of the GSA and DBM analyses. This allows for the pre-calibration of the the priors used for GLUE, in order to eliminate dynamical features of the TOPMODEL that have little effect on the model output and would be rejected at the structure identification phase of the DBM modelling analysis. In this way, the elements of meaningful subjectivity in the GLUE approach, which allow the modeler to interact in the modelling process by constraining the model to have a specific form prior to calibration, are combined with other more objective, data-based benchmarks for the final uncertainty estimation. GSA plays a major role in building a bridge between the hypothetico-deductive (bottom-up) and inductive (top-down) approaches and helps to improve the calibration of mechanistic hydrological models, making their properties more transparent. It also helps to highlight possible mis-specification problems, if these are identified. The results of the exercise show that the two modelling methodologies have good synergy; combining well to produce a complete joint modelling approach that has the kinds of checks-and-balances required in practical data-based modelling of rainfall-flow systems. Such a combined approach also produces models that are suitable for different kinds of application. As such, the DBM model considered in the paper is developed specifically as a vehicle for flow and flood forecasting (although the generality of DBM modelling means that a simulation version of the model could be developed if required); while TOPMODEL, suitably calibrated (and perhaps modified) in the light of the DBM and GSA results, immediately provides a simulation model with a variety of potential applications, in areas such as catchment management and planning.",,"Ratto, M|Young, PC|Romanowicz, R|Pappenberger, F|Saltelli, A|Pagano, A",HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES,,10.5194/hess-11-1249-2007

To this end, a dynamic ATAD model is presented and assessed. A global sensitivity analysis was performed to identify the operating conditions with the strongest impact on the energy requirements, and thus to choose the most promising optimisation variables. The latter turned out to be the aeration flowrate, the reaction time, and the sludge flowrate. The optimisation problem was formulated following the sequential approach for dynamic optimisation, due to the discontinuous nature of ATAD. The problem was implemented in MATLAB (R) and solved for two case studies using the eSS algorithm, a global scatter search method that alternates with local algorithms (in our case fmincon) to refine the best solutions. The two selected full-scale case studies include a single-stage and a two-stage system. For the former, a % improvement of the energy requirement was achieved after optimisation, and % for the latter.

The implementation of the ROM capabilities involves integration of three main computational components. The first component is the ROM itself. Two response surface approximations are currently implemented: Gaussian process regression (GPR) and radial basis function (RBF) interpolation. The second component is a multi-output adaptive sampling procedure that determines the sample points used to construct the ROMs. The third component involves defining appropriate error measures for the adaptive sampling procedure, allowing ROMs to be constructed efficiently with limited user intervention. Details in all three components must complement one another to obtain an accurate approximation. The new capability and its integration with other analysis tools within iTOUGH are demonstrated in two examples. The results from using the ROMs in an uncertainty quantification analysis and a global sensitivity analysis compare favorably with the results obtained using the HFMs. GPR is more accurate than RBF, but the difference can be small and similar conclusion can be deduced from the analyses. In the second example involving a realistic numerical model for a hypothetical industrial-scale carbon storage project in the Southern San Joaquin Basin, California, USA, significant reduction in computational effort can be achieved when ROMs are used to perform a rigorous global sensitivity analysis.", Published by Elsevier Ltd.,"Pau, GSH|Zhang, YQ|Finsterle, S|Wainwright, H|Birkholzer, J",COMPUTERS & GEOSCIENCES,surrogate models radial basis function gaussian process regression hydrogeology uncertainty quantification,10.1016/j.cageo.2013.08.008

Their performance has been tested extensively against observations and by model intercomparison studies. In the present analysis, Lund-Potsdam-Jena General Ecosystem Simulator (LPJ-GUESS), a state-of-the-art ecosystem model, was evaluated by performing a global sensitivity analysis. The study aims at examining potential model limitations, particularly with regard to long-term applications. A detailed sensitivity analysis based on variance decomposition is presented to investigate structural model assumptions and to highlight processes and parameters that cause the highest variability in the output. First- and total-order sensitivity indices were calculated for selected parameters using Sobol's methodology. In order to elucidate the role of climate on model sensitivity, different climate forcings were used based on observations from Switzerland. The results clearly indicate a very high sensitivity of LPJ-GUESS to photosynthetic parameters. Intrinsic quantum efficiency alone is able to explain about % of the variability in vegetation carbon fluxes and pools for a wide range of climate forcings. Processes related to light harvesting were also found to be important together with parameters affecting forest structure (growth, establishment, and mortality). The model shows minor sensitivity to hydrological and soil texture parameters, questioning its skills in representing spatial vegetation heterogeneity at regional or watershed scales. In the light of these results, we discuss the deficiencies of LPJ-GUESS and possibly that of other, structurally similar, dynamic vegetation models and we highlight potential directions for further model improvements.",,"Pappas, C|Fatichi, S|Leuzinger, S|Wolf, A|Burlando, P",JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES,dgvms global sensitivity analysis carbon allocation photosynthesis lpj-guess sobol' indices,10.1002/jgrg.20035
