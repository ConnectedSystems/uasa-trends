Application",MODELS,"Based on the theoretical framework for sensitivity analysis called ""Variogram Analysis of Response Surfaces'' (VARS), developed in the companion paper, we develop and implement a practical ""star-based'' sampling strategy (called STAR-VARS), for the application of VARS to real-world problems. We also develop a bootstrap approach to provide confidence level estimates for the VARS sensitivity metrics and to evaluate the reliability of inferred factor rankings. The effectiveness, efficiency, and robustness of STAR-VARS are demonstrated via two real-data hydrological case studies (a -parameter conceptual rainfall-runoff model and a -parameter land surface scheme hydrology model), and a comparison with the ""derivative-based'' Morris and ""variance-based'' Sobol approaches are provided. Our results show that STAR-VARS provides reliable and stable assessments of ""global'' sensitivity across the full range of scales in the factor space, while being - orders of magnitude more efficient than the Morris or Sobol approaches.",,"Razavi, S|Gupta, HV",WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,,10.1002/2015WR017559

However, building a high-fidelity model, particularly at large scales, remains a challenging task, due to complexities in model functioning and behaviour and uncertainties in model structure, parameterization, and data. Global sensitivity analysis (GSA), which characterizes how the variation in the model response is attributed to variations in its input factors (e.g., parameters and forcing data), provides an opportunity to enhance the development and application of these complex models. In this paper, we advocate using GSA as an integral part of the modelling process by discussing its capabilities as a tool for diagnosing model structure and detecting potential defects, identifying influential factors, characterizing uncertainty, and selecting calibration parameters. Accordingly, we conduct a comprehensive GSA of a complex land surface-hydrology model, Modelisation Environmentale-Surface et Hydrologie (MESH), which combines the Canadian land surface scheme with a hydrological routing component, WATROUTE. Various GSA experiments are carried out using a new technique, called Variogram Analysis of Response Surfaces, for alternative hydroclimatic conditions in Canada using multiple criteria, various model configurations, and a full set of model parameters. Results from this study reveal that, in addition to different hydroclimatic conditions and SA criteria, model configurations can also have a major impact on the assessment of sensitivity. GSA can identify aspects of the model internal functioning that are counter-intuitive and thus help the modeller to diagnose possible model deficiencies and make recommendations for improving development and application of the model. As a specific outcome of this work, a list of the most influential parameters for the MESH model is developed. This list, along with some specific recommendations, is expected to assist the wide community of MESH and Canadian land surface scheme users, to enhance their modelling applications.",,"Haghnegahdar, A|Razavi, S|Yassin, F|Wheater, H",HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,class hydrological modelling land surface modelling mesh model calibration model diagnostics sensitivity analysis uncertainty analysis vars,10.1002/hyp.11358

However, complex models, for example, the so-called physically based models, possess large degrees of freedom that, if not constrained properly, may lead to poor model performance when used for prediction. We argue that constraining a model to represent streamflow, which is an integrated resultant of many factors across the watershed, is necessary but by no means sufficient to develop a high-fidelity model. To address this problem, we develop a framework to utilize the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment's (GRACE) total water storage anomaly data as a supplement to streamflows for model calibration, in a multiobjective setting. The VARS method (Variogram Analysis of Response Surfaces) for global sensitivity analysis is used to understand the model behaviour with respect to streamflow and GRACE data, and the BORG multiobjective optimization method is applied for model calibration. Two subbasins of the Saskatchewan River Basin in Western Canada are used as a case study. Results show that the developed framework is superior to the conventional approach of calibration only to streamflows, even when multiple streamflow-based error functions are simultaneously minimized. It is shown that a range of (possibly false) system trajectories in state variable space can lead to similar (acceptable) model responses. This observation has significant implications for land-surface and hydrologic model development and, if not addressed properly, may undermine the credibility of the model in prediction. The framework effectively constrains the model behaviour (by constraining posterior parameter space) and results in more credible representation of hydrology across the watershed.",,"Yassin, F|Razavi, S|Wheater, H|Sapriza-Azuri, G|Davison, B|Pietroniro, A",HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,grace model state variable multiobjective optimization parameter identification pareto-optimal sensitivity analysis,10.1002/hyp.11267
3,WOS:000373117800025,2016,"A new framework for comprehensive, robust, and efficient global sensitivity analysis: 1. Theory",MODELS,"Computer simulation models are continually growing in complexity with increasingly more factors to be identified. Sensitivity Analysis (SA) provides an essential means for understanding the role and importance of these factors in producing model responses. However, conventional approaches to SA suffer from () an ambiguous characterization of sensitivity, and () poor computational efficiency, particularly as the problem dimension grows. Here, we present a new and general sensitivity analysis framework (called VARS), based on an analogy to ""variogram analysis,'' that provides an intuitive and comprehensive characterization of sensitivity across the full spectrum of scales in the factor space. We prove, theoretically, that Morris (derivative-based) and Sobol (variance-based) methods and their extensions are special cases of VARS, and that their SA indices can be computed as by-products of the VARS framework. Synthetic functions that resemble actual model response surfaces are used to illustrate the concepts, and show VARS to be as much as two orders of magnitude more computationally efficient than the state-of-the-art Sobol approach. In a companion paper, we propose a practical implementation strategy, and demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency, and reliability (robustness) of the VARS framework on real-data case studies.",,"Razavi, S|Gupta, HV",WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,,10.1002/2015WR017558
4,WOS:000416711800002,2017,Improved Understanding of River Ice Processes Using Global Sensitivity Analysis Approaches,ENVIRONMENTAL SYSTEMS MODELS FRAMEWORK ROBUST IMPACT FLOWS EARTH,"The high impact of river ice phenomena on the hydrology of cold regions has led to the extensive use of numerical models in simulating and predicting river ice processes. Consequently, there is a need to utilize efficient and robust sensitivity analysis (SA) methods to characterize the role of different parameters on the functioning of these models. To gain greater insight into how the internal parameters affect a river ice model's behavior, this paper presents a comparative performance investigation of the two global SA methods: () the recently proposed variogram analysis of response surfaces (VARS); and () the widely used regional sensitivity analysis (RSA). The methods were benchmarked on a one-dimensional hydrodynamic river ice model of the Lower Dauphin River, Manitoba, Canada. Furthermore, using a bootstrapping strategy, a procedure was developed to estimate confidence intervals on the resulting sensitivity indices and evaluate reliability of the inferred parameter rankings. Results show that () the water levels simulated by the river ice model are most sensitive to the ice cover characteristics (i.e., porosity and thickness at the ice cover front) and upstream discharge; () the hydraulic roughness parameters and slush ice properties (i.e., porosity and thickness of the slush pans) are medium-and low-sensitivity parameters, respectively; () the VARS and RSA methods provide contradictory assessments regarding the sensitivity of the model output to variations in the slush ice porosity and ice roughness parameters; and () the VARS method appears to be superior to RSA in terms of generating robust estimates of the parameter sensitivity rankings.", (C) 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.,"Sheikholeslami, R|Yassin, F|Lindenschmidt, KE|Razavi, S",JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGIC ENGINEERING,cold regions river ice modeling ice-induced floods global sensitivity analysis uncertainty analysis bootstrapping,10.1061/(ASCE)HE.1943-5584.0001574
5,WOS:000406177500010,2017,Insights into sensitivity analysis of Earth and environmental systems models: On the impact of parameter perturbation scale,LATIN HYPERCUBE DESIGNS GLOBAL SENSITIVITY HYDROLOGICAL MODEL GREAT-LAKES FRAMEWORK CALIBRATION ROBUST QUANTIFICATION SIMULATIONS ENSEMBLE,"This paper investigates the commonly overlooked ""sensitivity"" of sensitivity analysis (SA) to what we refer to as parameter ""perturbation scale"", which can be defined as a prescribed size of the sensitivityrelated neighbourhood around any point in the parameter space (analogous to step size Dx for numerical estimation of derivatives). We discuss that perturbation scale is inherent to any (local and global) SA approach, and explain how derivative-based SA approaches (e.g., method of Morris) focus on small-scale perturbations, while variance-based approaches (e.g., method of Sobol) focus on large-scale perturbations. We employ a novel variogram-based approach, called Variogram Analysis of Response Surfaces (VARS), which bridges derivative-and variance-based approaches. Our analyses with different real-world environmental models demonstrate significant implications of subjectivity in the perturbation-scale choice and the need for strategies to address these implications. It is further shown how VARS can uniquely characterize the perturbation-scale dependency and generate sensitivity measures that encompass all sensitivity-related information across the full spectrum of perturbation scales.
