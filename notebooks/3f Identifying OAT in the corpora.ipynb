      "The impact of resolution on the calculated property was also investigated. \n",

      "Therefore, a thorough resolution sensitivity analysis should be carried out to determine the degree of error associated with a system imaged at a given resolution. \n",

      "Thus, the isogeometric shape design sensitivity analysis is free from remeshing during the optimization process. \n",

      "In this paper, as a remedy for these problems, an isogeometric-based shape design sensitivity analysis and optimization methods are developed incorporating with T-spline basis. \n",

      "Numerical methods for shape design sensitivity analysis and optimization have been developed for several decades. \n",

      "\n",
      "The aim of this paper is i) to report the successful pilot-scale experimental validation of an Enzymatic Reactive Distillation (ERD) process for the synthesis of butyl butyrate and ii) to establish a rate-based model for conceptual process design which can be quickly adapted to other systems. \n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, these experiments are used to validate a predictive rate-based model to describe ERD which can be used to check the sensitivity of process and design parameters as well as to provide a quick adaption to other systems for quick evaluation. \n",
      "\n",
      "Experimental pilot-scale experiments show the feasibility of ERD and allow the comparison of the different packing types based on catalytic performance as well as stability. \n",
      "\n",
      "The main novelty is the application of a continuous RD column with enzymes as a heterogeneous catalyst provided in: two different types of catalytic packing: loosely filled immobilized enzyme beads in standard packings with catalyst pockets and gauze packings with catalytic coating. \n",
      "\n",
      "Using enzymes in an integrated reactive distillation process can overcome these limitations and provides a cost advantage over classic batch reactor processes. \n",
