      "The primary means by which AVI data was utilized was through the incorporation of prior observed OD information as measurements, the inclusion of a deterministic link volume component that makes use of OD data extracted from the latest time interval from which all trips have been completed, and through the use of link choice proportions estimated based on link travel time data. \n",

      "This paper presents a hybrid local-global sensitivity analysis method termed the Distributed Evaluation of Local Sensitivity Analysis (DELSA), which is used here to identify important and unimportant parameters and evaluate how model parameter importance changes as parameter values change. \n",
      "\n",
      "Results show that in both examples, Sobol' and DELSA identify similar important and unimportant parameters, with DELSA enabling more detailed insight at much lower computational cost. \n",

      "\n",
      "For example, in the real-world problem the time delay in runoff is the most important parameter in all models, but DELSA shows that for about % of parameter sets it is not important at all and alternative mechanisms and parameters dominate. \n",
